### ⚡️ Fast and feature-rich

✴️ [🌀Meta-plugins](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/search?q=meta+plugins) installs a group of complex plugins via a simple label, curated and optimal settings which are automatically applied.

✴️ [🌀Packages](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/ecosystem/packages) offloads from complex configurations and stores them as an easy to swap & share profiles.

✴️ [🌀Annexes](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/ecosystem/annexes) are extensions that are installed when required to provide additional functionality, and capabilities.

✴️ [🌀Turbo](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/getting_started/overview#turbo-mode-zsh--53) mode yields **50–80%** faster Zsh startup, just because no one likes to wait for someone :)

> 🥵 Currently biggest issue is that it seems to be too complex for new users and recently made some adjustments which are now starting to provide the results.

### ☑️ Neat and flexible

✴️ [Customize](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/guides/customization#customizing-paths) the paths, use [multiple prompts](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/guides/customization#multiple-prompts) in the same sessions by setting the triggers or create [your own](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/guides/customization#non-github-local-plugins) plugins to simplify or improve the routine.

✴️ Supports [Oh My Zsh](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/getting_started/overview#oh-my-zsh-prezto) and [Prezto](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/getting_started/overview#oh-my-zsh-prezto) plugins and libraries. ( [migration](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/getting_started/migration)).

✴️ Does not use **$FPATH** , loading multiple plugins doesn't clutter **$FPATH** with the same number of entries, e.g: 10, 15, even, or more.

✴️ Code is immune to **KSH_ARRAYS** and other options, which typically cause compatibility problems.

✴️ Do not require **sudo** , and provide many ways & workarounds to set up a clean and safe environment. e.g: setting so-called **shims** locally.

> If there is something that is not supported yet, I am pretty confident that if there will be reasonable demand - it will be implemented. 🔨

### 📈 Familiarize and control

✴️ Quickly familiarize oneself with a new plugin and provides rich and easy-to-digest information that might be helpful on various occasions.

✴️ [Load, unload](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/guides/commands#loading-and-unloading) plugins when required, use the ability to [manage](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/guides/commands#completions-management) completions.

✴️ Docker [playground](https://github.com/z-shell/playground) to test, view, or propose configurations.

✴️ [💫Gallery](https://z.digitalclouds.dev/docs/gallery/collection) of the user favorites.

> Is only limited to your own 🤦‍♂️ imagination… 🧙‍‍♀️ We need the support to make it better and more approachable to new users, become a 💞 friend of the DEV 💞, and more ☁️ cloud-native ☁️.
