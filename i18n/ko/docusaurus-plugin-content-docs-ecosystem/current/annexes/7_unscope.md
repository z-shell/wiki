## <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [z-shell/z-a-unscope][]

An aannex allows to install plugins without specifying the GitHub user name.

It works as follows:

1. On the installation of a plugin without any slashes (/) in its name the annex will query the GitHub API searching for **\*/{the-name}**, sorting on stars.

2. It first requires at least 10 forks on the candidates, then 2, then 0.

3. After finding the best result it sets it as the **full** remote-id of the plugin, storing the ID on disk for later automatic use.

4. For security, for such GH-API request to be made a newly added (by this annex) ice: `ghapi` is required to be given.

5. Otherwise only the static database of mappings of short-plugin nicknames to the full scoped IDs will be searched. It contains many mappings, like, e.g.: **vi-reg** â†’ **zsh-vi-more/evil-registers**, and also the usual basic unscopings of some of the popular plugins out there, like, e.g.: **zsh-syntax-highlighting** â†’ **zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting** and more.

## Static mappings

Besides the GitHub-API querying, there's also a fixed, curated list of mappings of short names to the full GitHub IDs. The list currently consists of:

|    Short (Nick-) Name     | GitHub ID / scoped ID             |

You can let me know if you would like a name to be added to the list.

## Usage examples

- An example installation via 2 nicknames (**env** and **vi-reg**) and by one unscoped (i.e.: not using any GitHub username) ID that's being dynamically resolved by a request to **GitHub API**:

![zi-for-command](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-unscope/raw/main/docs/images/unscope-zinit-for.png#center)

- An example call to the **zi scope â€¦** subcommand that is added by this annex. It allows to translate the unscoped IDs and the short-static nicknames into the full **username/repository** plugin ID.

![scope-subcommand](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-unscope/raw/main/docs/images/unscope-scope-cmd.png#center)

## Install unscope {#install-unscope}

Simply load as a regular plugin, i.e.:

```shell
zi light z-shell/z-a-unscope
```

It should be done possibly early in the `zshrc`, as otherwise the preceding `zi` calls will not have the unscoped IDs resolved.
