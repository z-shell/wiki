## <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [z-shell/z-a-readurl][]

An aannex allows to automatically download the newest version of a file to which URL is hosted on a webpage.

It works as follows:

- Invoke `snippet` (or simply pass the `http://â€¦` address using the `for` syntax) on the web-page that hosts the URL to the file to download, provide `dlink'â€¦'` ice with the expected file-download URL replacing the version with the `%VERSION%` keyword, also provide `as'â€¦'` ice with one of the following values:

1. `readurl`,
2. `readurl|command`,
3. `readurl|completion`,
4. `readurl|null`.

:::note

The part after the `|` has the same meaning as in the normal `as'â€¦'` ice.

:::

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi id-as=fzf as='readurl|command' extract for \
  dlink='/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases/download/%VERSION%/fzf-%VERSION%-linux_amd64.tgz' \
    https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases/
```

The snippet is just an example. The same effect is obtained by loading as `junegunn/fzf-bin` plugin with `from'gh-r'` ice.

As it can be seen, the `dlink'â€¦'` can be a relative or an absolute path and also a full URL (i.e.: beginning with the `http://â€¦` prefix).

## Intermediate download page

Sometimes, like it is in the case of [terraform][] command, the final download link isn't on the download page, but on a page that's listed on it. In such case use the `dlink0'â€¦'` ice to provide the pattern for the additional, intermediate download page. For example, in case of `terraform`, the ZI command is:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi id-as=terraform as='readurl|command' extract for \
  dlink0='/terraform/%VERSION%/' \
  dlink='/terraform/%VERSION%/terraform_%VERSION%_linux_386.zip' \
    http://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/
```

## Skipping `dlink'â€¦'` ice

Sometimes the URL of the download page differs from the URL of the archive in just a few `/`-sections. In such case, it is possible to skip the `dlink'â€¦'` ice by appending a `++`-separated fragment of the archive URL, like so:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi as'readurl|command' extract for \
  http://domain.com/download-page++/archive.zip
```

If the archive URL has some different `/`-sections, then it's possible to strip the conflicting ones from the download URL by using `+++`, `++++`, etc. â€“ the number of the `/`-section that'll be stripped equals to the number of the `+` minus 2. So, for example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi as'readurl|command' extract for \
  http://domain.com/download-page/removed-section+++/archive.zip
```

## Summary

The annex provides:

1. Two new ices: `dlink'â€¦'` and `dlink0'â€¦'`.
2. A handling of the special values of the `as''` ice, i.e.: of `as'readurl'`, `as'readurl|command'`, etc.

The annex works only with snippets, not plugins.

## Install Read URL

Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```shell
zi light z-shell/z-a-readurl
```

After executing the above command (possibly via `.zshrc`) it's then possible to use the `dlink'â€¦'` and `dlink0'â€¦'` ices and also the special `as'readurl|â€¦'` value of the `as''` ice.

## Sorting the matched URLs / package versions

Sometimes the download page doesn't list the package versions from newest to the oldest, but in some other order. In such case it's possible to sort the URLs / package versions by prepending the chosen `dlink` ice (`dlink0'â€¦'` or `dlink'â€¦'`) with the exclamation mark (`dlink'!â€¦'`, etc.). See the next section for an example:

## Filtering the matched URLs

Sometimes there are some unwanted URLs that match the `dlink'â€¦'`/`dlink0'â€¦'` regex / pattern. In such case it's possible to filter them out by appending a filtering regex to the `dlink'â€¦'` ice as: `dlink='the-main-regex~%the-unwanted-URLs-regex%'` (or the same for `dlink0'â€¦'`). An example package that can benefit from this is the [Open Shift][] client, which doesn't sort the URLs from latest to the oldest â€“ hence the exclamation mark (`!`) prepend â€“ and it has special URLs like `stable-4.4` or `candidate-4.5` together with the regular version URLs (like `4.5.0-rc.1`):

```shell showLineNumbers
zi id-as"ocp" as"readurl|command" for \
  dlink0'!%VERSION%~%(stable|latest|fast|candidate).*%' \
  dlink"openshift-client-windows-%VERSION%.zip" \
    https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/
```

The above snippet of Zsh code / ZI invocation will sort the URLs (`dlink0'!â€¦'`) and then filter out the special ones from the results (via `â€¦~%(stable|latest|fast|candidate).*%`), this way selecting the latest version of the Open Shift client.

## Other Examples

[Pulumi][], a tool to create, deploy, and manage modern cloud software.

```shell
zi id-as'pulumi' as'readurl|null' extract'!' for \
  dlink='https://get.pulumi.com/releases/sdk/pulumi-%VERSION%-linux-x64.tar.gz' \
  sbin'pulumi*' \
