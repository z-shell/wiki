## <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node][1]

An annex provides the following functionality:

1. Run programs and scripts without adding anything to `$PATH`,
2. Install: [Ruby Gems][2], [Node][3], and [Python][4] modules, with automatically set:
   - [$GEM_HOME][5]
   - [$NODE_PATH][6]
   - [$VIRTUALENV][7]
3. Run programs, scripts, and functions with automatic `cd` into the plugin or snippet directory, plus also with automatic standard output & standard error redirecting.
4. Source scripts through an automatically created function with the above `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, `$VIRTUALENV`, and `cd` features available,
5. Create the so-called `shims` known from [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) â€“ the same feature as the first item of this enumeration â€“ of running a program without adding anything to `$PATH` with all of the above features, however through an automatic **script** created in `$ZPFX/bin`, not a **function** (the first item uses a function-based mechanism),
6. Automatic updates of Ruby gems and Node modules during regular plugin and snippet updates with `zi update â€¦`.

## Install bin-gem-node

Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```shell
zi light z-shell/z-a-bin-gem-node
```

After executing this command you can then use the dl'â€¦' and patch'â€¦' ice-modifiers.

### How it works â€“ bird's-eye view

The `sbin'â€¦'` ice that creates forwarder-scripts instead of forwarder-functions (created by the `fbin'â€¦'` ice and elaborated in this `How it works â€¦` section) turned out to be the proper, best method for exposing binary programs and scripts. You can jump to the `sbin'â€¦'` ice [section](#sbin) if you want. This way there is no need to add anything to `$PATH` â€“ `z-a-bin-gem-node` will automatically create a function that will wrap the binary and provide it on the command line as if it was being placed in the `$PATH`. Also, as mentioned in the enumeration, the function can automatically export `$GEM_HOME`, `$NODE_PATH`, `$VIRTUALENV` shell variables and also automatically cd into the plugin or snippet directory right before executing the binary and then cd back to the original directory after the execution is finished. Also, as already mentioned, instead of the function an automatically created script â€“ the so-called `shim` â€“ can be used for the same purpose and with the same functionality, so that the command is being accessible practically fully normally â€“ not only in the live Zsh session (only within which the functions created by `fbin'â€¦'` exist) but also from any Zsh script.

### How it works

Suppose that you would want to install `junegunn/fzf` plugin from GitHub Releases, which contains only a single file â€“ the `fzf` binary for the selected architecture. It is possible to do it in the standard way â€“ by adding the plugin's directory to the `$PATH`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as'program' from'gh-r'
zi load junegunn/fzf
```

After this command, the `$PATH` variable will contain e.g.:

```shell showLineNumbers
% print $PATH
/home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
```

For many such programs loaded as plugins, the PATH can become quite cluttered. I've had 26 entries before switching to `z-a-bin-gem-node`. To solve this, load with the use of `sbin'â€¦'` ice provided and handled by `z-a-bin-gem-node`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as'program' from'gh-r' sbin'fzf'
zi load junegunn/fzf
```

The `$PATH` will remain unchanged and a `fzf` forwarder-script, so-called _shim_ will be created in `$ZPFX/bin` (`~/.zi/polaris/bin` by default), which is being already added to the `$PATH` by Zi when it is being sourced:

```shell showLineNumbers
% cat $ZPFX/bin/fzf
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

function fzf {
    local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf"
    "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}

fzf "$@"
```

Running the script will forward the call to the program accessed through an embedded path to it. Thus, no `$PATH` changes are needed!

### The Ice Modifiers provided by the annex

There are 7 ice modifiers provided and handled by the annex:

| Ice modifier      | Description                                                                                              |
|:----------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`sbin''`](#sbin) | Creates `shims` for binaries and scripts.                                                                |
| [`fbin''`](#fbin) | Creates functions for binaries and scripts.                                                              |
| [`gem''`](#gem)   | Installs and updates gems + creates functions for gems binaries.                                         |
| [`node''`](#node) | Installs and updates node_modules + creates functions for binaries of the modules.                       |
| [`pip''`](#pip)   | Installs and updates python packages into a virtualenv + creates functions for binaries of the packages. |
| [`fmod''`](#fmod) | Creates wrapping functions for other functions.                                                          |
| [`fsrc''`](#fsrc) | Creates functions that source given scripts.                                                             |
| [`ferc''`](#ferc) | The same as [`fsrc''`](#fscr), but using an alternate script-loading method.                             |

#### `SBIN''` {#sbin}

`sbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -> {name-of-the-script}]; â€¦'`

It creates the so-called `shim` known from `rbenv` â€“ a wrapper script that forwards the call to the actual binary. The script is created always under the same, standard, and single `$PATH` entry: `$ZPFX/bin` (which is `~/.zi/polaris/bin` by default). The flags have the same meaning as with `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi delete junegunn/fzf
Delete /home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf?
[yY/nâ€¦]
y
Done (action executed, exit code: 0)
% zi ice from"gh-r" sbin"fzf"
% zi load junegunn/fzf
â€¦installation messagesâ€¦
% cat $ZPFX/bin/fzf
#!/usr/bin/env zsh

function fzf {
    local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf"
    "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}

fzf "$@"
```

**The ice can be empty**. It will then try to create the shim for the trailing component of the `id_as` ice, e.g.:

- `id_as'exts/git-my'` â†’ it'll check if a file `git-my` exists and if yes, will create the function `git-my`.

- `paulirish/git-open` it'll check if a file `git-open` exists and if yes, will create the function `git-open`.

The same trailing component would be set for the snippet URL, for any alphabetically first and executable file.

#### `FBIN''` {#fbin}

`fbin'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-binary}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`

Creates a wrapper function of the name the same as the last segment of the path or as `{name-of-the-function}`.

| Flag | Description                                                                                                                  |
|:---- |:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `g`  | Set `$GEM_HOME` variable to `{plugin-dir}`.                                                                                  |
| `n`  | Set `$NODE_PATH` variable to `{plugin-dir}/node_modules`.                                                                    |
| `p`  | Set `$VIRTUALENV` variable to `{plugin-dir}/venv`.                                                                           |
| `c`  | `cd` to the plugin's directory before running the program and then cd back after it has been run.                            |
| `N`  | Append `&>/dev/null` to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect both standard output and standard error to `/dev/null`. |
| `E`  | Append `2>/dev/null` to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect standard error to `/dev/null`.                              |
| `O`  | Append `>/dev/null` to the call of the binary, i.e. redirect standard output to `/dev/null`.                              |

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi ice from"gh-r" fbin"g:fzf -> myfzf"
% zi load junegunn/fzf
% which myfzf
myfzf () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf"
        local -x GEM_HOME="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/junegunn---fzf"
        "$bindir"/"fzf" "$@"
}
```

The ice can be empty. It will then try to create the function for the trailing component of the `id_as` ice, e.g.:

- `id_as'exts/git-my'` â†’ it'll check if a file `git-my` exists and if yes, will create the function `git-my`.

- `paulirish/git-open` it'll check if a file `git-open` exists and if yes, will create the function `git-open`.

The same trailing component would be set for the snippet URL, for any alphabetically first and executable file.

#### `GEM''` {#gem}

`gem'{gem-name}; â€¦'`

**`gem'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{gem-name} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`**

Installs the gem of name `{gem-name}` with `$GEM_HOME` set to the plugin's or snippet's directory. In other words, the gem and its dependencies will be installed locally in that directory. In the second form, it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi ice gem'!asciidoctor'
% zi load z-shell/null
% which asciidoctor
asciidoctor () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null/bin"
        local -x GEM_HOME="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"
        "$bindir"/"asciidoctor" "$@"
}
```

#### `NODE''` {#node}

`node'{node-module}; â€¦'`

**`node'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{node-module} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`**

Installs the node module of name `{node-module}` inside the plugin's or snippet's directory. In the second form, it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi ice node'remark <- !remark-cli -> remark; remark-man'
% zi load z-shell/null
â€¦installation messagesâ€¦
% which remark
remark () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null/node_modules/.bin"
        local -x NODE_PATH="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"/node_modules
        "$bindir"/"remark" "$@"
}
```

In this case, the name of the binary program provided by the node module is different from its name, hence the second form with the `b <- a -> c` syntax has been used.

#### `PIP''` {#pip}

`pip'{pip-package}; â€¦'`

**`pip'[{path-to-binary} <-] !{pip-package} [-> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`**

Installs the node module of name `{pip-package}` inside the plugin's or snippet's directory. In the second form, it also creates a wrapper function identical to the one created with `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi ice pip'youtube-dl <- !youtube-dl -> youtube-dl'
% zi load z-shell/null
â€¦installation messagesâ€¦
% which youtube-dl
youtube-dl () {
        local bindir="/home/user/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null/venv/bin"
        local -x VIRTUALENV="/home/user/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"/venv
        local -xU PATH="/home/user/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"/venv/bin:"$bindir":"$PATH"
        "$bindir"/"youtube-dl" "$@"
}
```

In this case, the name of the binary program provided by the node module is different from its name, hence the second form with the `b <- a -> c` syntax has been used.

#### `FMOD''` {#fmod}

`fmod'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{function-name}; â€¦'`

**`fmod'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{function-name} -> {wrapping-function-name}; â€¦'`**

It wraps the given function with the ability to set `$GEM_HOME`, etc. â€“ the meaning of the `g`,`n` and `c` flags is the same as in the `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% myfun() { pwd; ls -1 }
% zi ice fmod'cgn:myfun'
% zi load z-shell/null
% which myfun
myfun () {
        local -x GEM_HOME="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"
        local -x NODE_PATH="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"/node_modules
        local oldpwd="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/zi---z-a-bin-gem-node"
        () {
                setopt localoptions noautopushd
                builtin cd -q "/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"
        }
        "myfun--za-bgn-orig" "$@"
        () {
                setopt localoptions noautopushd
                builtin cd -q "$oldpwd"
        }
}
% myfun
/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null
LICENSE
README.md
```

#### `FSCR''` {#fscr}

`fsrc'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-script}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`

#### `FERC''` {#ferc}

`ferc'[{g|n|c|N|E|O}:]{path-to-script}[ -> {name-of-the-function}]; â€¦'`

Creates a wrapper function that at each invocation sources the given file. The second ice, `ferc'â€¦'` works the same with the single difference that it uses `eval "$(<{path-to-script})"` instead of `source "{path-to-script}"` to load the script.

Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
% zi ice fsrc"myscript -> myfunc" ferc"myscript"
% zi load z-shell/null
% which myfunc
myfunc () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/plugins/z-shell---null"
        () {
                source "$bindir"/"myscript"
        } "$@"
}
% which myscript
myscript () {
        local bindir="/home/sg/.zi/snippets/OMZ::plugins--git/git.plugin.zsh"
        () {
                eval "$(<"$bindir"/"myscript")"
        } "$@"
}
```

**The ices can be empty**. They will then try to create the function for the trailing component of the `id-as'â€¦'` ice and the other cases, in the same way as with the `fbin'â€¦'` ice.

## Additional subcommands

:::info

To view subcommands registred by annexes run: `zi subcmds`.

:::

There's an additional Zi subcommand that is provided by annex â€“`shim-list`. It searches for and displays any shims that are currently stored under `$ZPFX/bin`:

![shim-list invocation][8]

Available flags are:

```shell
zi shim-list [-h/--help] [-t|--this-dir] [-i|--from-ices] [-o|--one-line] [-s|--short] [-c|--cat]
```

| Flag               | Description                                                                                       |
|:------------------ |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-h` `--help`      | Shows usage information.                                                                          |
| `-t` `--this-dir`  | Instructs Zi to look for shims in the current directory instead of `$ZPFX/bin`.                   |
| `-i` `--from-ices` | Normally the code looks for the shim files by examining their contents (**more info below [!]**). |
| `-o` `--one-line`  | Display the list of shim files without line breaks, in a single line, after spaces.               |
| `-s` `--short`     | Don't show the plugin/snippet that the shim belongs to.                                           |
| `-c` `--cat`       | Displays contents of each of the found shim (unimplemented yet).                                  |

> - [!] shims created by BGN annex have a fixed structure, this option instructs Zi to show the list of shims that results from the `sbin'â€¦'` ice of the loaded plugins. If a plugin for example has `sbin'git-open'`, means that such shim has already been created.

## Cygwin Support

The `sbin'â€¦'` ice has an explicit Cygwin support â€“ it creates additional, **extra shim files** â€“ Windows batch scripts that allow running the shielded applications from e.g.: Windows run dialog â€“ if the `~/.zi/polaris/bin` directory is being added to the Windows `PATH` environment variable, for example (it is a good idea to do so, IMHO). The Windows shims have the same name as the standard ones (which are also being created, normally) plus the `.cmd` extension. You can test the feature by e.g.: installing Firefox from the Zi package via:

```shell
zi pack=bgn for firefox
```
