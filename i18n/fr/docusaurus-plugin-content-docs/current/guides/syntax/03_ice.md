:::info FAQ: What is ice?

<span>
  <Image className="IceLogo" img={ZIceImg} alt="What is ice" />
  The <strong>ice</strong> is something that melts in a drink, though in Zi syntax, it means adding an <strong>ice-modifier</strong> that's temporary because it disappears â€“ which means that the <strong>ice-modifier</strong> will last only for the next Zi command.
</span>

## <i class="fas fa-arrow-down-short-wide"></i> Order of execution {#order-of-execution}

Order of execution of related ice modifiers is as follows:

```shell showLineNumbers
  atinit'' â†’
    atpull'!' â†’
      make'!!' â†’
        mv'' â†’
          cp'' â†’
            make'!' â†’
              atclone'' / atpull'' â†’
                make'!' â†’
                [ plugin script loading ] â†’
                  src'' â†’
                    multisrc'' â†’
                      atload''
```

### <i class="fas fa-circle-info"></i> A few remarks {#a-few-remarks}

- The syntax automatically detects if the object is a snippet or a plugin, by checking if the object is an URL, i.e.: if it starts with `http*://` or `OMZ::`, etc.
- To load a local-file snippet (which will be treated as a local-directory plugin by default) use the `is-snippet` ice,
- To load a plugin in `light` mode use the `light-mode` ice.
- If the plugin name collides with an ice name, precede the plugin name with `@`, e.g.: `@sharkdp/fd` (collides with the `sh` ice, ZI will take the plugin name as `sh"arkdp/fd"`), see the next section for an example.

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `extract'â€¦'` {#extract}

A swiss-knife tool for unpacking all kinds of archives â€“ the `extract'â€¦'` ice. It works in two modes â€“ automatic mode and fixed mode.

### Automatic mode

It is active if the ice is empty (or contains only flags â€“ more on them later). It works as follows:

1. At first, a recursive search for files of known [file extensions](#supported-file-formats) located not deeper than in a sub-directory is being performed. All such found files are then extracted.
   - The directory-level limit is to skip extraction of some helper archive files, which are typically located somewhere deeper in the directory tree.
2. **IF** no such files will be found, then a recursive search for files of known archive **types** will be performed. This is basically done by running the `file` Unix command on each file in the plugin or snippet directory and then grepping the output for strings like `Zip`, `bzip2`, etc. All such discovered files are then extracted.
   - The directory-level requirement is imposed also during this stage - files located deeper in the tree than in a sub-directory are omitted.
3. If no archive files will be discovered then no action is being performed and also no warning message is being printed.

### Fixed mode

It is active when a filename is being passed as the `extract`'s argument, e.g.: `zi extract=archive.zip for z-shell/null`. Multiple files can be specified â€“ separated by spaces. In this mode all and only the specified files are being extracted.

### Filenames with spaces

The filenames with spaces in them are supported by a trick â€“ to correctly pass such a filename to `extract` use the non-breaking space in place of the in-filename original spaces.

The non-breaking space is easy to type by pressing right <kbd>ALT</kbd> and the <kbd>SPACE</kbd>.

### Flags

The value of the ice can begin with a two special characters:

1. Exclamation mark (`!`), i.e.: `extract='!â€¦'` â€“ it'll cause the files to be moved one directory-level up upon unpacking,
2. Two exclamation mark (`!!`), i.e.: `extract='!!â€¦'` â€“ it'll cause the files to be moved two directory-level up upon unpacking,
3. Dash (`-`), i.e.: `extract'-â€¦'` â€“ it'll prevent removal of the archive after unpacking.
   - This flag is useful to allow comparing timestamps with the server in case of snippet-downloaded file â€“ it will prevent unnecessary downloads during `zi update`, as the timestamp of the archive file on the disk will be first compared with the HTTP last-modification time header.

The flags can be combined in any order: `extract'!-'`.

### <i class="fas fa-gears"></i> `ziextract` {#ziextract}

Sometimes a more uncommon unpacking operation is needed. In such case you can directly use the function that implements the ice â€“ it is called `ziextract`.

It recognizes the following options:

1. `--auto` â€“ runs the automatic extraction.
2. `--move` â€“ performs the one-directory-level-up move of the files after unpacking.
3. `--move2` â€“ performs the two-directory-level-up move of the files after unpacking.
4. `--norm` - prevents the archive file removal.
5. And also one option specific only to the function: `--nobkp`, which prevents clearing of the plugin's dir before the extraction â€“ normally all the files except the archive are being moved into `._backup` directory and after that the extraction is performed. - `extract` ice also skips creating the backup **if** more than one archive is found or given as the argument.

### <i class="fas fa-circle-info"></i> Supported file formats {#supported-file-formats}

Zip, rar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, tar.xz, tar.7z, tar, tgz, tbz2, gz, bz2, txz, xz, 7z, exe, deb, OS X (dmg).

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `from'â€¦'` {#from}

In order to install and load a plugin whose repository is private - e.g: requires providing credentials in order to log in â€“ use the `from'â€¦'` ice in the following way:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice from"user@github.com"
zi load user/fsh-auto-themes
```

Current preset:

| Ice name   | Domain name / URL                      |
|:---------- |:-------------------------------------- |
| ge         | gitee.com                              |

:::note

If the `from'â€¦'` ice isn't one of above table, then **it is treaten as a domain name** and inserted into the domain position into the `git clone` url:

```shell
git clone https://{from-ice-contents}/user/plugin
```

In order to change the protocol, use the `proto'â€¦'` ice.

:::

### <i class="fas fa-book-bookmark"></i> Summary of `from'â€¦'` {#summary-of-from}

By using this method you can clone plugins from e.g. GitHub Enterprise or embed the passwords as plain text in `.zshrc`.

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `id-as'â€¦'` {#id-as}

Load a plugin or snippet with a nickname with the `id-as'â€¦'` ice-modifier. For example, one could try to load [docker/compose][1] from GitHub binary releases:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" from"gh-r" mv"docker-c* -> docker-compose"
zi light "docker/compose"
```

This registers plugin under the ID `docker/compose`. Now suppose the user would want to also load a completion from the project's GitHub repository (not the binary release catalog) which is also available under the GitHub url-path **â€¦/docker/compose**. The two IDs, both being "docker/compose", will collide.

The solution to this problem â€“ the `id-as'â€¦'` (to be read as: _identify-as_) ice to which this document is devoted: by using the `id-as'â€¦'` ice the user can resolve the conflict by loading the completion under a kind of a _nickname_, for example under "_dc-complete_", by issuing the following commands:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"completion" id-as"dc-complete"
zi load docker/compose
```

The plugin (of the type `completion`) is now seen under ID `dc-complete`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi list | grep -i dc-complete
dc-complete
```

Issuing `zi report dc-complete` also works, so as other ZI command:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi report dc-complete

Plugin report for dc-complete
-------------------------------

Completions:
_docker-compose [enabled]
```

This can be also used to nickname snippets. For example, you can use this to create handy IDs in place of long URLs:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" id-as"git-unique"
zi snippet https://github.com/Osse/git-scripts/blob/master/git-unique
```

The commands `zi update git-unique`, `zi delete git-unique` and other will work normally and e.g. `zi times` will show the _nickname_-ID `git-unique` instead of the long URL.

### `id-as'auto'` {#id-asauto}

There's a special value to the `id-as'â€¦'` ice â€“ `auto`. It causes the nickname to be automatically set to the last component of the plugin name or snippet URL. For example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" id-as"auto"
zi snippet https://github.com/Osse/git-scripts/blob/master/git-unique
```

will work the same as before, e.g: like if the ice used was `id-as'git-unique'`. Will work as if id-as'zsh-autopair' was passed:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait lucid id-as"auto"
zi load hlissner/zsh-autopair
```

### Empty `id-as'â€¦'` {#empty-id-as}

An empty `id-as'â€¦'` will work the same as `id-as'auto'`, i.e.:

```shell showLineNumbers
# Will work as if id-as'zsh-autopair' was passed
zi ice wait lucid id-as
zi load hlissner/zsh-autopair
```

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `wait'â€¦'` {#wait}

:::note

Turbo mode, i.e. the `wait'â€¦'` ice that implements it - needs Zsh >= 5.3.

:::

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'0' # or just: zi ice wait
zi light wfxr/forgit
```

- waits for prompt,
- instantly ("0" seconds) after prompt loads given plugin.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'[[ -n ${ZLAST_COMMANDS[(r)cras*]} ]]'
zi light z-shell/zi-crasis
```

- `$ZLAST_COMMANDS` is an array build by [F-Sy-H][2], it contains commands currently entered at prompt,
- `(r)` searches for element that matches given pattern (`cras*`) and returns it,
- `-n` means: not-empty, so it will be true when users enters "cras",
- after 1 second or less, ZI will detect that `wait'â€¦'` condition is true, and load the plugin, which provides command _crasis_,
- screencast that presents the feature: [![screencast][3]][4]

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'[[ $PWD = */github || $PWD = */github/* ]]'
zi load unixorn/git-extra-commands
```

it waits until user enters a `github` directory. Turbo mode also support a suffix â€“ the letter `a`, `b` or `c`. The meaning is illustrated by the following example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0b" as"command" pick"wd.sh" atinit"echo Firing 1" lucid
zi light mfaerevaag/wd
zi ice wait"0a" as"command" pick"wd.sh" atinit"echo Firing 2" lucid
zi light mfaerevaag/wd

# The output
Firing 2
Firing 1
```

As it can be seen, the second plugin has been loaded first. That's because there are now three sub-slots (the `a`, `b` and `c`) in which the plugin/snippet loadings can be put into. Plugins from the same time-slot with suffix `a` will be loaded before plugins with suffix `b`, etc.

In other words, instead of `wait'1'` you can enter `wait'1a'`, `wait'1b'` and `wait'1c'` â€“ to this way **impose order** on the loadings **regardless of the order of `zi` commands**.

### `zi-turbo 'â€¦' for â€¦` {#zi-turbo--for-}

The `zi-turbo` is a funtion to simplify `wait`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi-turbo () {
   zi depth'3' lucid ${1/#[0-9][a-d]/wait"${1}"} "${@:2}"
}
```

Then use with the `for` syntax in the imposed loading order:

```shell {1,6,10,15} showLineNumbers
zi-turbo '0a' for \
  OMZL::git.zsh \
  OMZL::compfix.zsh \
  OMZL::functions.zsh \

zi-turbo '0b' for \
  OMZL::prompt_info_functions.zsh OMZL::spectrum.zsh \
  OMZL::clipboard.zsh OMZL::termsupport.zsh OMZL::directories.zsh

zi-turbo '1a' for \
  OMZP::sudo OMZP::encode64 \
    atload"unalias grv g" OMZP::git \
  OMZP::gcloud OMZP::nvm OMZP::gem OMZP::rust

zi-turbo '1b' for \
  MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use
```

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `src'â€¦'` `pick'â€¦'` `multisrc'â€¦'` {#src-pick-multisrc}

Normally `src'â€¦'` can be used to specify additional file to source:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice pick'powerless.zsh' src'utilities.zsh'
zi light martinrotter/powerless
```

|  Syntax   | Description                                                                                        |
|:---------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pick'â€¦'` | Provide main file to source - like `*.sh`, otherwise alphabetically first matched file is sourced. |
| `src'â€¦'`  | Provide second file to source - not a pattern - plain file name.                                   |

### The `svn` ice {#the-svn-ice}

However, via `atload'â€¦'` ice one can provide simple loop to source more files:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn pick'completion.zsh' \
  atload'local f; for f in git.zsh misc.zsh; do source $f done'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

|   Syntax    | Description                                                                                                                        |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `svn`    | Use Subversion to clone `OMZ::lib` (the whole Oh-My-Zsh `lib/` directory). More [^1].                                              |
| `atload'â€¦'` | Code isn't tracked and cannot be unloaded. The `atload'â€¦'` is executed after loading main files `pick'â€¦'` and `src'â€¦'`. More [^2]. |

### The `multisrc'â€¦'` ice {#the-multisrc-ice}

Loads **multiple** files enumerated with spaces as the separator (e.g. `multisrc'misc.zsh grep.zsh'`) and also using brace-expansion syntax (e.g. `multisrc'{misc,grep}.zsh')`. Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn pick'completion.zsh' \
  multisrc'git.zsh functions.zsh {history,grep}.zsh'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

The all possible ways to use the `multisrc'â€¦'` ice-modifier:

```shell
zi ice depth'1' multisrc='lib/{functions,misc}.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi load robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
```

Can use patterns:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn multisrc'{funct*,misc}.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn multisrc'misc.zsh functions.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Will use the array's value at the moment of plugin load:

> This can matter in case of using turbo mode.

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc"\$array" pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Compatible with KSH_ARRAYS option:

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc"${array[*]}" pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Hack with ZI: the ice's contents is simply `eval`-uated like follows: eval "reply=($multisrc)".

So it might get handy on an occasion to pass code there, but first you must close the paren and then don't forget to assign `reply`, and to provide a trailing opening paren. In the code be careful to not redefine any variable used internally by ZI â€“ e.g.: `i` is safe:

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc'); local i; for i in $array; do reply+=( ${i/.zsh/.sh} ); done; ((1)' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Extended with the [for][8] syntax which can in some situations replace a typical `multisrc'â€¦'` loading. The point is that this syntax allows to easily specify snippets to source â€“ and do this within a single ZI command.

Instead of:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice multisrc'(functions|misc|completion).zsh'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

it's possible to write:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi for \
  OMZL::functions.zsh \
  OMZL::misc.zsh \
  OMZL::completion.zsh
```

which is somewhat easier on eyes.

:::info Important Property

The multiple snippets loaded with the `for` syntax are being loaded _separately_, which means that they will not cause a longer keyboard blockage, which could have been noticeable â€“ when using Turbo.

:::

The ZI scheduler will distribute the work over time and will allow activation of keyboard in between the snippets. The `multisrc'â€¦'` way doesn't work this way â€“ sourcing many files can cause noticeable keyboard freezes (in Turbo).

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `wrap'â€¦'` {#wrap}

The `wrap' â€¦'` ice-modifier allows to extend the tracking (e.g: gathering of report and unload data) of a plugin beyond the moment of sourcing it's main file(s). It works by wrapping the given functions with a tracking-enabling and disabling snippet of code. This is useful especially with prompts, as they very often do their initialization in the first call to their `precmd` [hook][5] function.

For example, [romkatv/powerlevel10k][6] works this way. The ice takes a list of function names, with the elements separated by `;`:

```shell
zi ice wrap"func1;func2;â€¦"
```

### Use case for `wrap'â€¦'` {#use-case-for-wrap}

Therefore, to e.g. load and unload the example powerlevel10k prompt in the fashion of [multiple prompts][7] article, the `precmd` function of the plugin â€“ called `_p9k_precmd`, to get the name of the function do `echo $precmd_functions` after loading a theme, should be passed to `wrap'â€¦'` ice.

Load when `MYPROMPT == 4`

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice load'![[ $MYPROMPT = 4 ]]' unload'![[ $MYPROMPT != 4 ]]' \
  atload'source ~/.p10k.zsh; _p9k_precmd' wrap'_p9k_precmd'
zi load romkatv/powerlevel10k
```

This way the actions done during the first call to `_p9k_precmd()` will be normally recorded, which can be viewed in the report of the [**romkatv/powerlevel10k**][6] theme:

```shell showLineNumbers
âžœ zi report romkatv/powerlevel10k:
Report for romkatv/powerlevel10k plugin
---------------------------------------

```

### Summary of `wrap'â€¦'`

As it can be seen, creation of four additional Zle-widgets has been recorded - `Zle -N â€¦` lines. They will be properly deleted/restored on the plugin unload with `MYPROMPT=3` as example and the shell state will be clean, ready to load a new prompt.

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `atclone'â€¦'` `atpull'â€¦'` `atinit'â€¦'` `atload'â€¦'` {#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload}

There are four code-receiving ices: `atclone'â€¦'`, `atpull'â€¦'`, `atinit'â€¦'`, `atload'â€¦'`.

Their role is to **receive a portion of Zsh code and execute it in certain moments of the plugin life-cycle**.

|    Syntax    | Execution moment                                                |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atclone'â€¦'` | **after cloning** the associated plugin or snippet to the disk. |
| `atpull'â€¦'`  | **after updating** the associated plugin or snippet.            |
| `atinit'â€¦'`  | **before loading** of the associated plugin or snippet.         |
| `atload'â€¦'`  | **after loading** of the associated plugin or snippet.          |

For convenience, you can use each of the ices multiple times in single `zi ice â€¦` invocation â€“Â all the passed commands will be executed in the given order.

The `atpull'â€¦'` ice recognizes a special value: `%atclone`, so the code looks: `atpull'%atclone'`. It causes the contents of the `atclone'â€¦'` ice to be copied into the contents of the `atpull'â€¦'` ice.

This is handy when the same tasks have to be performed on clone **and** on update of plugin or snippet, like e.g.: in the [direnv example][9].

### `atload'!â€¦'` with exclamation mark preceded

The [wrap'â€¦'](#wrap) ice-modifier allows to track and unload plugins that defer their initialization into a function run later after sourcing the plugin's script â€“ when the function is called, the plugin is then being fully initialized.

However, if the function is being called from the `atload'â€¦'` ice, then an the _exclamation mark_-preceded method can be used with `atload'â€¦'` contents. The exclamation mark causes the effects of the execution of the code passed to `atload'â€¦'` ice to be recorded.

### Use case for `atload'â€¦'`

For example, in the following invocation:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as'test' atload'!PATH+=:~/share'
zi load z-shell/null
```

the `$PATH` is being changed within `atload'â€¦'` ice. ZI's tracking records `$PATH` changes and withdraws them on plugin unload, and also shows information loading:

```shell showLineNumbers
âžœ zi report test
Report for test plugin
----------------------
Source  (reporting enabled)

PATH elements added:
/home/sg/share
```

As it can be seen, the `atload'â€¦'` code is being correctly tracked and can be unloaded & viewed. Below is the result of using the `unload'â€¦'` subcommand to unload the `test` plugin:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi unload test
--- Unloading plugin: test ---
Removing PATH element /home/user/share
Unregistering plugin test
Plugin report saved to $LASTREPORT
```

The same example as in the [wrap'â€¦'](#use-case-for-wrap) article, but using the _exclamation mark_-preceded `atload'â€¦'` instead of `wrap'â€¦'`:

Load when - `MYPROMPT == 4`

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice load'![[ $MYPROMPT = 4 ]]' unload'![[ $MYPROMPT != 4 ]]' \
  atload'!source ~/.p10k.zsh; _p9k_precmd'
zi load romkatv/powerlevel10k
```

<!-- end-of-file -->

[^1]: Note that `atload'â€¦'` uses apostrophes not double quotes, to literally put `$f` into the string, `atload'â€¦'`'s code is automatically being run **within the snippet's (or plugin's) directory**.
[^2]: Unless you load a plugin (not a snippet) with `zi load â€¦` and prepend the value of the ice with exclamation mark. Example: `atload'!local f; for â€¦'`.
