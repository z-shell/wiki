## <i class="fas fa-circle-info"></i> Introduction

Zi 为结构化语句或表达式提供了两种语法类型：

- Standard syntax
- The ["For"][for-syntax] syntax

用户可以自行决定使用哪种语法，但强烈建议熟悉这两种语法。 在本例中，我们将使用一个空存储库 [z-shell/0](https://github.com/z-shell/0) 来练习标准语法的基础知识。

- 在终端中执行下列命令：

```shell
zi load z-shell/0
```

成功安装 Zsh 插件，该插件通常包含 [Zsh 插件标准](https://wiki.zshell.dev/community/zsh_plugin_standard) 中描述的所有设置说明。

代码片段是一个带有可重用源代码一部分的单一文件。 机器代码或文本，需要文件的完整路径或 URL。

> - 在终端中执行下列命令：

```shell
zi snippet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zi-src/main/lib/zsh/snippets/welcome.zsh
```

Success! 但并不总是一切都那么容易和简单，有时我们也希望某些事情在特定的时间或条件下发生。 This can be achieved using [ice-modifiers][ice-mods].

顶部行包含 ice - modifiers ，而底部行是插件。

> - 在终端中执行下列命令：

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as'zsh/plugin' atinit'print "Hello World!"'
zi load z-shell/0
```

这将在 [插件 ID](#id-as)`zsh/plugin`，而不是 `z-shell/0` 下注册插件。 这将按预期工作，例如， `zi update zsh/plugin`， ` zi remove zsh/plugin`，等等。 The "Hello World!" printed before loading the plugin

请使用更多的 ice - modifiers 重新安装。

> - 在终端中执行下列命令：

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as'final/countdown' \
  atinit'+zi-message "{bapo}Cloned!"' \
  atclone'+zi-message "{quos}Boom!"' \
  atload'+zi-message "{apo}Loaded!"' countdown
zi load z-shell/0
```

## <i class="fas fa-arrow-down-short-wide"></i> Order of execution {#order-of-execution}

The order of execution of related ice-modifiers is as follows:

```shell showLineNumbers
  atinit'' →
    atpull'!' →
      make'!!' →
        mv'' →
          cp'' →
            make'!' →
              atclone'' / atpull'' →
                make'!' →
                [ plugin script loading ] →
                  src'' →
                    multisrc'' →
                      atload''
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-list"></i> A few remarks {#a-few-remarks}

- The syntax automatically detects if the object is a snippet or a plugin, by checking if the object is an URL, i.e.: if it starts with `http*://` or `OMZ::`, etc.
- To load a local-file snippet (which will be treated as a local-directory plugin by default) use the `is-snippet` ice,
- To load a plugin in `light` mode use the `light-mode` ice.
- If the plugin name collides with an ice name, precede the plugin name with `@`, e.g.: `@sharkdp/fd` (collides with the `sh` ice, ZI will take the plugin name as `sh"arkdp/fd"`), see the next section for an example.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-list"></i> Syntax alternatives {#syntax-alternatives}

Zi supports alternatives such as the equal (`=`) syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as=equal atload="print Hello World"
zi load z-shell/0
```

The colon (`:`) syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as:colon atload:"print Hello World"
zi load z-shell/0
```

And also – in conjunction with all of the above – the GNU syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as=GNU --atload="print Hello World"
zi load z-shell/0
```

The syntax alternatives can utilize the highlighting of editors like Vim – and have the strings and ice expressions colorized with a distinct color. However, with [zi-vim-syntax][] the syntax definition can be superseded with the highlighting specifically for Zi. syntax definition can be superseded with the highlighting specifically for Zi.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-nodes"></i> Utilizing "make" {#utilizing-make}

Vim repository on GitHub – a typical source code that needs compilation, Zi can manage the run of `./configure` and other `make` stuff. Ice-modifier `pick` adds the binary program to `$PATH`. You could also install the package under the path $ZPFX.

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" atclone"rm -f src/auto/config.cache; ./configure" \
  atpull"%atclone" make pick"src/vim"
zi light vim/vim
```

The `make'…'` ice could also be: `make"install PREFIX=$ZPFX"`, if "install" wouldn't be the only, default target.

:::info

[$ZPFX][zpfx] is provided by Zi, it is set to `~/.zi/polaris` by default. However, it can be changed by specifying the `$ZPFX=` target.

:::

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" pick"$ZPFX/bin/git-*" make"PREFIX=$ZPFX"
zi light tj/git-extras
```

The `Makefile` of the project above has only 2 tasks:

1. 安装目标。
2. 构建安装所需的脚本。

The `Makefile` with 2 tasks, can use:

1. `make"all install PREFIX=…"`,
2. `pick'…'` will `chmod +x` all matching files and add `$ZPFX/bin/` to `$PATH`.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-arrows-to-dot"></i> Compiling programs {#compiling-programs}

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" atclone"rm -f src/auto/config.cache; ./configure" \
  atpull"%atclone" make pick"src/vim"
zi light vim/vim

### <i class="fa-solid fa-palette"></i> LS_COLORS {#ls_colors}

A repository [trapd00r/LS_COLORS][trapd00r-ls_colors] provides a file with color definitions for GNU `ls` command, and also for [ogham/exa][ogham-exa]. Typically one does `eval $( dircolors -b $HOME/LS_COLORS)` to process this file and set the environment for `ls`. This means `dircolors` is run by every shell startup. It costs much time to create a fork and program, i.e., the `dircolors` binary needs to be loaded to obtain and process the color definitions. The following invocation solves this problem:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice atclone'dircolors -b LS_COLORS > clrs.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' pick"clrs.zsh" nocompile'!' \
  atload'zstyle ":completion:*" list-colors ${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}'
zi light trapd00r/LS_COLORS
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Syntax             | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `atclone'…'`       | Generate shell script, passing it to `eval`. More: [^1]                                     |
| `atpull'%atclone'` | Do the same at any update of the plugin. More: [^2]                                         |
| `pick"clrs.zsh"`   | Source the previously generated file `clrs.zsh`.                                            |
| `nocompile'!'`     | Invokes compilation **after** the `atclone'…'` and the [exclamation][] mark causes this.    |
| `atload'…'`        | Additionally sets up the Zsh completion to use the colors provided by the trapd00r package. |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

This way, except for the plugin installation and update, `dircolors` isn't run, just normal sourcing is done. The everyday sourced file, i.e. `clrs.zsh`, is being compiled to speed up the loading.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-folder-tree"></i> Direnv {#direnv}

The project [direnv/direnv][direnv-direnv] registers itself in the Z shell to modify the environment on directory change. This registration is most often done by `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` added to `.zshrc`.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' src"zhook.zsh"
zi light direnv/direnv
```

- `make'!'` – execute `make` before `atclone'…'` and before `atpull'…'` (see `make` above),
- `src'zhook.zsh'` – source file `zhook.zsh`.

In general, `direnv` works by hooking up to Zsh. The code that does this is provided by the program `direnv` (built by `make'…'`).

Above `atclone'…'` puts this code into file `zhook.zsh`, `src''` sources it. This way `direnv hook zsh` is executed only on clone and update, and Zsh starts faster.

#### <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> Glance at the 'for' syntax {#glance-at-the-for-syntax}

The drawback of this standard procedure is that the `direnv` binary is run on every shell startup and significantly slows it down. Zi allows to solve this in the following way:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' pick"direnv" src"zhook.zsh" for \
    direnv/direnv
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Syntax             | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make'!'`          | Compile `direnv`, the exclamation mark means: run the `make` first, before `atclone'…'` and `atpull'…'` hooks.                 |
| `atclone'…'`       | As soon as the plugin is installed generate the registration code and save it to `zhook.zsh`, instead of passing it to `eval`. |
| `atpull'%atclone'` | The `atclone'…'` runs on **installation** while `atpull'…'` runs on **update** of the plugin.                                  |
| `src'zhook.zsh'`   | Load generated registration code                                                                                               |
| `pick'direnv'`     | Ensure `+x` permission on the binary                                                                                           |
| `as'program'`      | The plugin is a program, there's no main file to the source.                                                                   |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

In this method, the registered code is generated once on every installation or update, then sourced without running `direnv` itself. The project is also available as a binary [GitHub releases][gh-releases]. This distribution can be installed by:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi from"gh-r" as"program" mv"direnv* -> direnv" \
  atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' atpull'%atclone' \
  pick"direnv" src="zhook.zsh" for \
    direnv/direnv
```

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `extract'…'` {#extract}

A swiss-knife tool for unpacking all kinds of archives – the `extract'…'` ice. It works in two modes – automatic mode and fixed mode.

Automatic mode:

It is active if the ice is empty (or contains only flags). It works as follows:

1. At first, a recursive search for files of known [file extensions](#supported-file-formats) located not deeper than in a sub-directory is being performed. All such found files are then extracted.
   - The directory-level limit is to skip extraction of some helper archive files, which are typically located somewhere deeper in the directory tree.
2. **If** no such files will be found, then a recursive search for files of known archive **types** will be performed. This is done by running the `file` Unix command on each file in the plugin or snippet directory and then grepping the output for strings like `Zip`, `bzip2`, etc. All such discovered files are then extracted.
   - The directory-level requirement is imposed during this stage. The files located deeper than in a sub-directory are omitted.
3. If no archive files will be discovered then no action is being performed and also no warning message is being printed.

Fixed mode:

It is active when a filename is being passed as the `extract`'s argument, e.g.: `zi extract=archive.zip for z-shell/null`. Multiple files can be specified – separated by spaces. In this mode all and only the specified files are being extracted.

Filenames with spaces:

The filenames with spaces are supported when correctly passing such filenames to an `extract` with the non-breaking spaces for the original in-filename.

The non-breaking space is easy to type by pressing right <kbd>ALT</kbd> and the <kbd>SPACE</kbd>.

Flags:

The value of the ice can begin with two special characters:

1. Exclamation mark (`!`), i.e.: `extract='!…'` – it'll cause the files to be moved one directory level up upon unpacking,
2. Two exclamation marks (`!!`), i.e.: `extract='!!…'` – it'll cause the files to be moved two directory-level up upon unpacking,
3. Dash (`-`), i.e.: `extract'-…'` – it'll prevent removal of the archive after unpacking.
   - This flag allows comparing timestamps with the server in case of snippet-downloaded file – it will prevent unnecessary downloads during `zi update`, as the timestamp of the archive file on the disk will be first compared with the HTTP last-modification time header.

The flags can be combined in any order: `extract'!-'`.

## <i class="fas fa-gears"></i> `ziextract` {#ziextract}

Sometimes a more uncommon unpacking operation is needed. In such a case you can directly use the function that implements the ice – it is called `ziextract`.

It recognizes the following options:

1. `--auto` – runs the automatic extraction.
2. `--move` – performs the one-directory-level-up move of the files after unpacking.
3. `--move2` – performs the two-directory-level-up move of the files after unpacking.
4. `--norm` - prevents the archive file removal.
5. And also one option specific only to the function: `--nobkp`, which prevents clearing the plugin's directory before the extraction. – All files besides the archive are being moved into the `._backup` directory after extraction is done. - `extract` ice also skips creating the backup **if** more than one archive is found or given as the argument.

### <i class="fas fa-circle-info"></i> Supported file formats {#supported-file-formats}

Zip, rar, tar.gz, tar.bz2, tar.xz, tar.7z, tar, tgz, tbz2, gz, bz2, txz, xz, 7z, exe, deb, OS X (dmg).

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `from'…'` {#from}

To install and load a plugin whose repository is private - e.g: requires providing credentials to log in – use the `from'…'` ice in the following way:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice from"user@github.com"
zi load user/fsh-auto-themes
```

:::note

If the `from'…'` ice isn't one of the above tables, then **it is treated as a domain name** and inserted into the domain position into the `git clone` URL:

```shell
git clone https://{from-ice-contents}/user/plugin
```

In order to change the protocol, use the `proto'…'` ice.

:::

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `id-as'…'` {#id-as}

Load a plugin or snippet with a nickname with the `id-as'…'` ice-modifier. For example, one could try to load [docker/compose][docker-compose] from GitHub binary releases:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" from"gh-r" mv"docker-c* -> docker-compose"
zi light "docker/compose"
```

This registers the plugin under the ID `docker/compose`. Now suppose the user would want to also load a completion from the project's GitHub repository (not the binary release catalog) which is also available under the GitHub URL **…/docker/compose**. The two IDs, both being "docker/compose", will collide.

The solution to this problem – the `id-as'…'` (to be read as _identify-as_) ice to which this document is devoted: by using the `id-as'…'` ice the user can resolve the conflict by loading the completion under a kind of a _nickname_, for example under "_dc-complete_", by issuing the following commands:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"completion" id-as"dc-complete"
zi load docker/compose
```

The plugin (of the type `completion`) is now seen under ID `dc-complete`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi list | grep -i dc-complete
dc-complete
```

Issuing `zi report dc-complete` will work as with regular command:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi report dc-complete

Plugin report for dc-complete
-------------------------------

Completions:
_docker-compose [enabled]
```

The same method applies to nickname snippets. For instance, use it to create handy IDs in place of long URLs:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" id-as"git-unique"
zi snippet https://github.com/Osse/git-scripts/blob/master/git-unique
```

The commands `zi update git-unique`, and `zi delete git-unique` will work as expected and e.g. `zi times` will show the _nickname_-ID `git-unique` instead of the long URL.

- `id-as'auto'`:

There's a special value to the `id-as'…'` ice – `auto`. It causes the nickname to be automatically set to the last component of the plugin name or snippet URL. For example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" id-as"auto"
zi snippet https://github.com/Osse/git-scripts/blob/master/git-unique
```

will work the same as before, e.g: if the ice used was `id-as'git-unique'`. Will work as if id-as'zsh-autopair' was passed:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait lucid id-as"auto"
zi load hlissner/zsh-autopair
```

- empty `id-as'…'`:

An empty `id-as'…'` will work the same as `id-as'auto'` as if id-as'zsh-autopair' was passed, e.g:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait lucid id-as
zi load hlissner/zsh-autopair
```

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `wait'…'` {#wait}

:::note

Turbo mode, i.e. the `wait'…'` is ice that implements it - needs Zsh >= 5.3.

:::

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'0' # or just: zi ice wait
zi light wfxr/forgit

- waits for prompt,
- instantly ("0" seconds) after prompt loads given plugin.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'[[ -n ${ZLAST_COMMANDS[(r)cras*]} ]]'
zi light z-shell/zi-crasis
```

- screencast that presents the feature:

<ImgShow height='390.78' width='970' img='/img/cast/svg/crasis_01.svg' alt='Crasis example screencast' />

- `$ZLAST_COMMANDS` is an array built by [F-Sy-H][z-shell-f-sy-h], it contains commands currently entered at prompt,
- `(r)` searches for an element that matches a given pattern (`cras*`) and returns it,
- `-n` means: not-empty, so it will be true when users enter "cras",
- after 1 second or less, Zi will detect that the `wait'…'` condition is true, and load the plugin, which provides command _crasis_,

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait'[[ $PWD = */github || $PWD = */github/* ]]'
zi load unixorn/git-extra-commands
```

it waits until the user enters a `github` directory. Turbo mode also supports a suffix – the letter a, `b`, or `c`. The meaning is illustrated by the following example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0b" as"command" pick"wd.sh" atinit"echo Firing 1" lucid
zi light mfaerevaag/wd
zi ice wait"0a" as"command" pick"wd.sh" atinit"echo Firing 2" lucid
zi light mfaerevaag/wd
```

will output:

```shell showLineNumbers
Firing 2
Firing 1
```

As can be seen, the second plugin has been loaded first. That's because there are now three sub-slots (the `a`, `b`, and `c`) into which the plugin/snippet loadings can be put. Plugins from the same time slot with suffix `a` will be loaded before plugins with suffix `b`, etc.

In other words, instead of `wait'1'`, you can enter `wait'1a'`, `wait'1b'`, and `wait'1c'` – this **imposes the loading order** of the **commands** regardless of actual execution time.

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `src'…'` `pick'…'` `multisrc'…'` {#src-pick-multisrc}

Normally `src'…'` can be used to specify the additional file to the source:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice pick'powerless.zsh' src'utilities.zsh'
zi light martinrotter/powerless
```

|  Syntax   | Description                                                                                                |
| :-------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pick'…'` | Provide the main file to the source - like `*.sh`, otherwise alphabetically first matched file is sourced. |
| `src'…'`  | Provide a second file to the source - not a pattern - plain file name.                                     |

### The `svn` ice {#the-svn-ice}

However, via `atload'…'` ice one can provide a simple loop to source more files:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn pick'completion.zsh' \
  atload'local f; for f in git.zsh misc.zsh; do source $f done'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

|  Syntax     | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `svn`     | Use Subversion to clone `OMZ::lib` (the whole Oh-My-Zsh `lib/` directory). More [^3].                                              |
| `atload'…'` | Code isn't tracked and cannot be unloaded. The `atload'…'` is executed after loading main files `pick'…'` and `src'…'`. More [^4].                    |

### The `multisrc'…'` ice {#the-multisrc-ice}

Loads **multiple** files enumerated with spaces as the separator (e.g. `multisrc'misc.zsh grep.zsh'`) and also using brace-expansion syntax (e.g. `multisrc'{misc,grep}.zsh')`. Example:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn pick'completion.zsh' \
  multisrc'git.zsh functions.zsh {history,grep}.zsh'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

All possible ways to use the `multisrc'…'` ice-modifier:

```shell
zi ice depth'1' multisrc='lib/{functions,misc}.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi load robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
```

Can use patterns:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn multisrc'{funct*,misc}.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice svn multisrc'misc.zsh functions.zsh' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Will use the array's value at the moment of plugin load:

> This can matter when using turbo mode.

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc"\$array" pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Compatible with KSH_ARRAYS option:

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc"${array[*]}" pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Hack with Zi: the ice's contents are simply `eval`-uated like follows: eval "reply=($multisrc)".

So it might get handy on an occasion to pass code there, but first, you must close the paren and then don't forget to assign `reply`, and to provide a trailing opening paren. In the code be careful to not redefine any variable used internally by Zi – e.g.: `i` is safe:

```shell showLineNumbers
array=({functions,misc}.zsh)
zi ice svn multisrc'); local i; for i in $array; do reply+=( ${i/.zsh/.sh} ); done; ((1)' pick'/dev/null'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

Extended with the [for][for-syntax] syntax which can in some situations replace a typical `multisrc'…'` loading. The idea of this syntax is to source multiple snippets with a single command.

Instead of:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice multisrc'(functions|misc|completion).zsh'
zi snippet OMZ::lib
```

it's possible to write:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi for \
  OMZL::functions.zsh \
  OMZL::misc.zsh \
  OMZL::completion.zsh
```

which is somewhat easier on the eyes.

:::info Important Property

The multiple snippets loaded with the `for` syntax are being loaded _separately_, which means that they will not cause a longer keyboard blockage, which could have been noticeable – when loading in turbo mode.

:::

The Zi scheduler will distribute the work over time and will allow activation of the keyboard in between the snippets. The `multisrc'…'` way doesn't work this way – sourcing many files may cause a noticeable keyboard freeze (in turbo mode).

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `atclone'…'` `atpull'…'` `atinit'…'` `atload'…'` {#atclone-atpull-atinit-atload}

There are four code-receiving ice-modifiers: `atclone'…'`, `atpull'…'`, `atinit'…'`, `atload'…'`.

Their role is to **receive a portion of Zsh code and execute it in specific moments of the plugin life-cycle**.

|   Syntax     | Execution moment                                                |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atclone'…'` | **after cloning** the associated plugin or snippet to the disk. |
| `atpull'…'`  | **after updating** the associated plugin or snippet.            |
| `atinit'…'`  | **before loading** of the associated plugin or snippet.         |
| `atload'…'`  | **after loading** of the associated plugin or snippet.          |

For convenience, you can use each of the ices multiple times in a single `zi ice …` invocation – all commands will run in the given order.

The `atpull'…'` ice recognizes a special value: `%atclone`, so the code looks: `atpull'%atclone'`. It causes the contents of the `atclone'…'` ice to be copied into the contents of the `atpull'…'` ice.

This is handy when the same tasks have to be performed on clone **and** on the update of plugin or snippet, like e.g.: in the [direnv example](#direnv).

### `atload'!…'` with exclamation mark preceded

The [wrap'…'](#wrap) The ice-modifier allows the track and unload of plugins that defer their initialization to a function and run later after sourcing the plugin's script – When the function call, the plugin is then fully initialized.

However, if the function is being called from the `atload'…'` ice, then the _exclamation mark_-preceded method can be used with `atload'…'` contents. The exclamation mark causes the effects of the execution of the code passed to `atload'…'` ice to be recorded.

### Use case for `atload'…'`

For example, in the following invocation:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice id-as'test' atload'!PATH+=:~/share'
zi load z-shell/null
```

the `$PATH` is being changed within `atload'…'` ice. Zi's tracking registers `$PATH` changes and withdraws them on the plugin unload and shows loading information:

```shell title="zi report test" showLineNumbers
Report for test plugin
----------------------
Source  (reporting enabled)

PATH elements added:
/home/sg/share
```

As it can be seen, the `atload'…'` code is being correctly tracked and can be unloaded & viewed. Below is the result of using the `unload'…'` subcommand to unload the `test` plugin:

```shell title="zi unload test" showLineNumbers
--- Unloading plugin: test ---
Removing PATH element /home/user/share
Unregistering plugin test
Plugin report saved to $LASTREPORT
```

The same example as in the [wrap'…'](#use-case-for-wrap) article, but using the _exclamation mark_-preceded `atload'…'` instead of `wrap'…'`:

Load when - `MYPROMPT == 4`

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice load'![[ $MYPROMPT = 4 ]]' unload'![[ $MYPROMPT != 4 ]]' \
  atload'!source ~/.p10k.zsh; _p9k_precmd'
zi load romkatv/powerlevel10k
```

## <i class="fas fa-microchip"></i> `wrap'…'` {#wrap}

The `wrap' …'` ice-modifier allows extending the tracking (e.g.: the gathering of the report and unloading data) of a plugin beyond the moment of sourcing its main file(s). It works by wrapping the given functions with a tracking-enabling and disabling snippet of code. This is useful especially with prompts, as they very often do their initialization in the first call to their `precmd` [hook][hook-functions] function.

For example, [romkatv/powerlevel10k][romkatv-powerlevel10k] works this way. The ice takes a list of function names, with the elements separated by `;`:

```shell
zi ice wrap"func1;func2;…"
```

### Use case for `wrap'…'` {#use-case-for-wrap}

Therefore, to load and unload for the example powerlevel10k prompt in the fashion of [multiple prompts][multiple-prompts] article, the `precmd` function of the plugin – called `_p9k_precmd`, to get the name of the function do `echo $precmd_functions` after loading a theme, should be passed to `wrap'…'` ice.

Load when `MYPROMPT == 4`

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice load'![[ $MYPROMPT = 4 ]]' unload'![[ $MYPROMPT != 4 ]]' \
  atload'source ~/.p10k.zsh; _p9k_precmd' wrap'_p9k_precmd'
zi load romkatv/powerlevel10k
```

This way the actions done during the first call to `_p9k_precmd()` will be normally recorded, which can be viewed in the report of the [romkatv/powerlevel10k][romkatv-powerlevel10k] theme:

```shell title="zi report romkatv/powerlevel10k" showLineNumbers
Report for romkatv/powerlevel10k plugin
---------------------------------------

Autoload is-at-least with options -U -z

```

Summary of `wrap'…'`:

As it can be seen, the creation of four additional Zle-widgets has been recorded - `Zle -N …` lines. They will be properly deleted/restored on the plugin unload with `MYPROMPT=3` as an example and the shell state will be clean, ready to load a new prompt.

[^1]: Save it to a file. The `atclone'…'` is being run on the **installation** while the `atpull'…'` hook is being run on an **update** of the [**trapd00r/LS_COLORS**][trapd00r-ls_colors] plugin.
[^2]: The `%atclone` is just a special string that denotes the `atclone'…'` hook and is copied onto the `atpull'…'` hook.
[^3]: Note that `atload'…'` uses apostrophes, not double quotes, to put `$f` into the string, `atload'…'`'s code is automatically being run **within the snippet's or plugin's directory**.
