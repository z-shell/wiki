| `atinit'…'` | loads the `zsh/zprof` module, shipped with Zsh, before loading the plugin – this starts the profiling.                   |
| `atload'…'` | works after loading the plugin – shows profiling results `zprof / head`, unloads `zsh/zprof` - this stops the profiling. |

While in effect, only a single plugin, in this case, `z-shell/F-Sy-H`, will be profiled.

The rest plugins will go on completely normally, as when plugins are loaded with `light` - reporting is disabled.

Less code is being run in the background, the automatic data gathering, during loading of a plugin, for the reports and the possibility to unload the plugin will be activated and the functions will not appear in the `zprof` report.

Example `zprof` report:

<ReportZprofExample />

The first column is the time in milliseconds:

-   It denotes the amount of time spent in a function in total
-   For example, `--zi-shadow-autoload` consumed 10.71 ms of the execution time

The fourth column is also a time in milliseconds, but it denotes the amount of time spent on executing only of function's **own code**, it doesn't count the time spent in **descendant functions** that is called from the function:

-   For example, `--zi-shadow-autoload` spent 8.71 ms on executing only its code

The table is sorted in the **self-time** column.

### Method 1

> `PROFILE_STARTUP=true` to enable profiling.

Place the snippet below at the top of `.zshrc`.

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
PROFILE_STARTUP=false

if [[ "$PROFILE_STARTUP" == true ]]; then
  zmodload zsh/zprof
  PS4=$'%D{%M%S%.} %N:%i> '
  exec 3>&2 2>$HOME/startlog.$$
  setopt xtrace prompt_subst
fi
```

:::info PS4 Prompt Expansion

Zsh Sourceforge docs: [Prompt Expansion][prompt-expansion]

:::

Place at the bottom of `.zshrc`

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
if [[ "$PROFILE_STARTUP" == true ]]; then
  unsetopt xtrace
  exec 2>&3 3>&-; zprof > ~/zshprofile$(date +'%s')
fi
```

The next time your `.zshrc` is sourced it will generate 2 files in the `$HOME` directory.

### Method 2

Store multiple values to a variable:

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
# Set variable
typeset -Ag ZLOGS
# Message to store
zmsg() { ZLOGS+=( "\n[$1]: ${(M)$(( SECONDS * 1000 ))#*.?} ms" ); }

# Start profiling
typeset -F4 SECONDS=0

# <RUN SOME FUNCTIONS TO MEASURE>

zmsg "Loaded functions"

# <RUN SOMETHING ELSE>

zmsg "Loaded something else"

# <THE FINAL CODE BLOCK HERE>

zmsg "Done"
```

Then use the `$ZLOGS` variable to retrieve:

```shell title="print $ZLOGS" showLineNumbers
[Loaded functions]: 0.0 ms
[Loaded something else]: 0.0 ms
[Done]: 0.1 ms
```
