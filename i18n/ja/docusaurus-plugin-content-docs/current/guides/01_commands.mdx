## Updates {#updates-upgrades}

To update and recompile Zi run `zi self-update` in the command line. To update all plugins and snippets, issue `zi update`. To update all in parallel (up to 40 at the time) `zi update -p 40` If you wish to update only a single plugin/snippet instead issue `zi update <plugin-name>`. A list of commits will be shown if any.

Some plugins require acting each time they're updated. One way you can do this is by using the `atpull'‚Ä¶'` ice modifier. For example, writing `zi ice atpull'./configure'` before loading a plugin will execute `./configure` after a successful update. Refer to [ice-modifiers][1] for more information.

The ice-modifiers for any plugin or snippet are stored in their directory in a `._zi` subdirectory, hence the plugin doesn't have to be loaded to be correctly updated. There's one other file created there, `.zi_lstupd` ‚Äì it holds the log of the new commits pulled-in in the last update.

Self-update & compile:

```shell
zi self-update
```

## Compinit

:::note

Calling `compinit` once is a huge performance gain, for example, shell startup time with double `compinit`: **0.980** sec, with `cdreplay` and single `compinit`: **0.156** sec.

:::

### Calling `compinit` without turbo mode

With no turbo mode in use, compinit can be called normally, i.e.: as `autoload compinit; compinit`. This should be done after loading all plugins and before possibly calling `zi cdreplay`. The `cdreplay` subcommand is provided to re-play all caught `compdef` calls. The `compdef` calls are used to define a completion for a command. For example, `compdef _git git` defines that the `git` command should be completed by a `_git` function. The `compdef` function is provided by the `compinit` call.

As it should be called later, after loading all of the plugins, Zi provides its own `compdef` function that catches (i.e.: records in an array) the arguments of the call, so that the loaded plugins can freely call `compdef`. Then, the `cdreplay` (compdef-replay) can be used, after `compinit` will be called (and the original `compdef` function will become available), to execute all detected `compdef` calls.

```shell title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

zi load "some/plugin"

(‚Ä¶)

compdef _gnu_generic fd  # this will be intercepted by ZI, because as the compinit
                         # isn't yet loaded, thus there's no such function `compdef'; yet
                         # ZI provides its own `compdef' function which saves the
                         # completion-definition for later possible re-run with `zi
                         # cdreplay' or `zicdreplay' (the second one can be used in hooks
                         # like atload'‚Ä¶', atinit'‚Ä¶', etc.)

(‚Ä¶)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

zi cdreplay -q      # -q is for quiet; actually, run all the `compdef's saved before
                    #`compinit` call (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so
                    # it cannot be used until `compinit' is run; ZI solves this
                    # via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and storing them for later
                    # use with `zi cdreplay')
```

### Calling `compinit` with turbo mode

If you load completions using `wait'‚Ä¶'` [turbo mode][2] then you can add `atinit'zicompinit'` to the syntax-highlighting plugin (which should be the last one loaded, as their (2 projects, [zsh-syntax-highlighting][3] & [F-Sy-H][4]) documentation state), or `atload'zicompinit'` to last completion-related plugin. `zicompinit` is a function that just runs `autoload compinit; compinit`, created for convenience.

Alternatively, the `zicompinit` can be replaced with `zicompinit_fast` which checks the cached `.zcompdump` and determines when to regenerate the file. This restricts checking it once a day, as compinit doesn't always need to modify the compdump and compiles mapped to share in the background in multiple shells.

There's also `zicdreplay` which will replay any caught compdefs so you can also do: `atinit'zicompinit; zicdreplay'`, etc.

It is recommended to run the `compinit` call in the `atinit` or `atload` hook of the last related plugin with the use of the helper functions `zicompinit`,`zicdreplay` & `zicdclear` as shown below:

```shell {10} title="~/.zshrc" showLineNumbers
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

# Load using the for-syntax
zi wait lucid for \
  "some/plugin"

zi wait lucid for \
  "other/plugin"

zi wait lucid atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf for \
  zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

### Ignoring compdefs

If you want to ignore compdefs provided by some plugins or snippets, place their load commands before commands loading other plugins or snippets, and issue `zi cdclear` (or `zicdclear`, designed to be used in hooks like `atload'‚Ä¶'`):

```shell showLineNumbers
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh
zi snippet OMZP::git
zi cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided by Git plugin

zi load "some/plugin"

(‚Ä¶)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
zi cdreplay -q # <- execute compdefs provided by rest of plugins
zi cdlist # look at gathered compdefs
```

The `cdreplay` is important if you use plugins like `OMZP::kubectl` or `asdf-vm/asdf` because these plugins call `compdef`.

Following commands are passed to `zi ‚Ä¶` to obtain described effects.

[^1]: There's also `light-mode` ice which can be used to induce the no-investigating (i.e.: _light_) loading, regardless of the command used.
[^2]: The URL can use the following shorthands: `PZT::` (Prezto), `PZTM::` (Prezto module), `OMZ::` (Oh-My-Zsh), `OMZP::` (OMZ plugin), `OMZL::` (OMZ library), `OMZT::` (OMZ theme), e.g.: `PZTM::environment`, `OMZP::git`, etc.
[^3]: The `'‚Ä¶'` can be an absolute path, i.e.: it's possible to also add regular directories. If the option `-f` or `--front` is given, the directory path is prepended instead of appended to `$fpath`.
[^4]: If the option `-l` will be given then the plugin should be skipped ‚Äì the option will cause the previous plugin to be reused.
