## <i class="fa-solid fa-keyboard"></i> Bindkey

The `bindkey` key mappings can be very confusing to decipher. It can use multiple different notations but it's smart to use the same key notation throughout your configuration.

You can print all of your current key bindings in the current keymap with `bindkey`. To print the full `bindkey` command to add to your `.zshrc` file use `bindkey -L`.

In general you'll bind a widget so a key sequence or a key with modifier. This can be declared in [caret notation][5] using `^`, using [escape sequences][6] using `\`, in octal (`\NNN`), hex (`\xNN`), or unicode (`\uNNNN`). None of these are particularly great for people to read.

This is also tricky because it depends on your keyboard, operating system, and shell. Here are some basics

- `\e`, `\E`, = Escape
- `^[` = Alt key (on some keyboards this is the same as escape)
- `^?` = Delete
- `^X`, `^` = Control

The keys that come after the modifier can add more confusion.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-delete-left"></i> Delete key binding

To delete a key binding you can use `bindkey -d $KEYS`. Make sure you don't delete characters you need for typing.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-sliders"></i> The `bindmap'â€¦'` keybindings

Sometimes plugins call [bindkey][1] to assign keyboard shortcuts. This can cause problems because multiple plugins can bind the same keys.

Also, the user might want a different binding(s), which will require complicated, additional `bindkey` commands in `.zshrc`.

ZI provides a solution to this problem â€“ the ability to remap the bindkeys with a short [ice-modifier][2] specification with the `bindmap'â€¦'` [ice][3].

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> `bindmap'â€¦'`pavyzdÅ¾iai

Map Ctrl-G instead of Ctrl-R for the history searcher.

```shell
zi bindmap'^R -> ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word
```

Map Ctrl-Shift-Left and â€¦-Right used by URxvt instead of the Xterms' ones. Load with the bindkey-tracking â†” with light-loading for anything else.

Could also separate the bindmaps with a semicolon, i.e.:

```shell
bindmap'"\\e[1\;6D" -> \\e[1\;5D ; "\\e[1\;6C" -> ^[[1\;5C' \
```

```shell showLineNumbers
zi wait light-mode trackbinds bindmap'"\\e[1\;6D" -> \\e[1\;5D"' \
  bindmap'"\\e[1\;6C" -> ^[[1\;5C' pick'dircycle.zsh' for \
  michaelxmcbride/zsh-dircycle
```

Map space to regular space and Ctrl-Space to the `globalias' widget, which expands the alias entered on the left, provided by OMZ globalias plugin.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi bindmap='!" " -> magic-space; !"^ " -> globalias' nocompletions \
  depth=1 pick=plugins/globalias/globalias.plugin.zsh for \
  ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Explanation

The `bindmap'â€¦'` ice has two modes of operation: normal and exclamation-mark (`bindmap'!â€¦'`). In the first mode, the remapping is being done from-key to-key, i.e.: `bindmap'fromkey -> to-key'`.

The given key is being changed to the second given key in the `bindkey` command that's being issued when loading the plugin. In the second mode, the remapping is being done from-key to-widget, e.g: `bindmap'!from-key -> to-widget'`.

In this mode, the given key is being mapped to the given widget instead of the widget specified in the `bindkey` command e.g.:

Instead of:

```shell showLineNumbers
bindkey "^ " magic-space
bindkey " " globalias
```

The actual call that'll be done will be:

```shell showLineNumbers
bindkey "^ " globalias
bindkey " " magic-space
```

For the `bindmap='!" " -> magic-space; !"^ " -> globalias'` ice.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Using `bindmap'â€¦'` in light mode

When the investigation mode is on i.e.:

- when the full loading mode is being used, default in the `for` syntax and when `zi load â€¦` is used, then the `bindmap'â€¦'` ice works normally.

In the non-investigation:

- the [light mode](/search/?q=light+mode) â€“ activated when `zi light â€¦` or the `light-mode` ice is being used â€“ the `bindmap'â€¦'` is unavailable, unless the `trackbinds` ice is specified:

```shell showLineNumbers
# With use of the light-mode ice and the for-syntax:
zi light-mode trackbinds bindmap'^R -> ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word
```

```shell showLineNumbers
# With use of the classic syntax:
zi trackbinds bindmap'^R -> ^G' for z-shell/history-search-multi-word
zi light z-shell/history-search-multi-word
```

### <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check"></i> Using the <kbd>UPAR</kbd> shorthands

There are four special values that can be used on the left side of the bind-map: <kbd>UPAR</kbd>, <kbd>DOWNAR</kbd>, <kbd>LEFTAR</kbd>, <kbd>RIGHTAR</kbd>. They'll match up arrow, down arrow, etc. So that it's possible to do:

```shell
zi bindmap='LEFTAR -> ^F; RIGHTAR -> ^G' â€¦
```

The benefits of using the <kbd>UPAR</kbd>, â€¦ shorthands is that they cover multiple possible cursor-key codes for each of the cursor key, so that they'll work regardless of the terminal being used.
