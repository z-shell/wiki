## Updating ZI and plugins

To update ZI issue `zi self-update` in the command line.

To update all plugins and snippets, issue `zi update`.

To update all in parallel (up to 40 at the time) `zi update -p 40`

If you wish to update only a single plugin/snippet instead issue `zi update NAME_OF_PLUGIN`.

A list of commits will be shown if any.

Some plugins require performing an action each time they're updated.

One way you can do this is by using the `atpull` ice modifier.

For example, writing `zi ice atpull'./configure'` before loading a plugin will execute `./configure` after a successful
update.

Refer to [Ice Modifiers][1] for more information.

The ice modifiers for any plugin or snippet are stored in their directory in a `._zi` subdirectory, hence the plugin
doesn't have to be loaded to be correctly updated.

There's one other file created there, `.zi_lstupd` – it holds the log of the new commits pulled-in in the last update.

## Calling `compinit` without turbo mode

With no Turbo mode in use, compinit can be called normally, i.e.: as `autoload compinit; compinit`.

This should be done after loading of all plugins and before possibly calling `zi cdreplay`.

The `cdreplay` subcommand is provided to re-play all caught `compdef` calls.

The `compdef` calls are used to define a completion for a command. For example, `compdef _git git` defines that the
`git` command should be completed by a `_git` function.

The `compdef` function is provided by `compinit` call.

As it should be called later, after loading all of the plugins, ZI provides its own `compdef` function that catches
(i.e.: records in an array) the arguments of the call, so that the loaded plugins can freely call `compdef`.

Then, the `cdreplay` (compdef-replay) can be used, after `compinit` will be called (and the original `compdef` function
will become available), to execute all detected `compdef` calls.

To summarize:

```shell title="~/.zshrc"
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

zi load "some/plugin"

(…)

compdef _gnu_generic fd  # this will be intercepted by ZI, because as the compinit
                         # isn't yet loaded, thus there's no such function `compdef'; yet
                         # ZI provides its own `compdef' function which saves the
                         # completion-definition for later possible re-run with `zi
                         # cdreplay' or `zicdreplay' (the second one can be used in hooks
                         # like atload'…', atinit'…', etc.)

(…)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit

zi cdreplay -q      # -q is for quiet; actually, run all the `compdef's saved before
                    #`compinit` call (`compinit' declares the `compdef' function, so
                    # it cannot be used until `compinit' is run; ZI solves this
                    # via intercepting the `compdef'-calls and storing them for later
                    # use with `zi cdreplay')
```

This allows calling compinit once.

:::tip

Performance gains are huge, for example, shell startup time with double `compinit`: **0.980** sec, with `cdreplay` and
single `compinit`: **0.156** sec.

:::

## Calling `compinit` with turbo mode

If you load completions using `wait'…'` [turbo mode][2] then you can add `atinit'zicompinit'` to the syntax-highlighting
plugin (which should be the last one loaded, as their (2 projects, [zsh-syntax-highlighting][3] & [F-Sy-H][4])
documentation state), or `atload'zicompinit'` to last completion-related plugin.

`zicompinit` is a function that just runs `autoload compinit; compinit`, created for convenience.

There's also `zicdreplay` which will replay any caught compdefs so you can also do: `atinit'zicompinit; zicdreplay'`,
etc.

Basically, the whole topic is the same as normal `compinit` call, but it is done in `atinit` or `atload` hook of the
last related plugin with the use of the helper functions (`zicompinit`,`zicdreplay` & `zicdclear` – see below for
explanation of the last one).

### Summary of `compinit` call

```shell {10} title=~/.zshrc
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh

# Load using the for-syntax
zi wait lucid for \
    "some/plugin"

zi wait lucid for \
    "other/plugin"

zi wait lucid atload"zicompinit; zicdreplay" blockf for \
    zsh-users/zsh-completions
```

### Ignoring compdefs

If you want to ignore compdefs provided by some plugins or snippets, place their load commands before commands loading
other plugins or snippets, and issue `zi cdclear` (or `zicdclear`, designed to be used in hooks like `atload'…'`):

```shell
source ~/.zi/bin/zi.zsh
zi snippet OMZP::git
zi cdclear -q # <- forget completions provided by Git plugin

zi load "some/plugin"

(…)

zi load "other/plugin"

autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
zi cdreplay -q # <- execute compdefs provided by rest of plugins
zi cdlist # look at gathered compdefs
```

The `cdreplay` is important if you use plugins like `OMZP::kubectl` or `asdf-vm/asdf`, because these plugins call
`compdef`.

Following commands are passed to `zi …` to obtain described effects.

| `snippet` `-f` `URL` | Source local or remote file (by direct URL). `-f` – don't use cache (force redownload). The URL can use the following shorthands: `PZT::` (Prezto), `PZTM::` (Prezto module), `OMZ::` (Oh My Zsh), `OMZP::` (OMZ plugin), `OMZL::` (OMZ library), `OMZT::` (OMZ theme), e.g.: `PZTM::environment`, `OMZP::git`, etc. |
