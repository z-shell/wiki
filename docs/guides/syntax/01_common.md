It is recommended to familiarize yourself with [getting_started/overview][] before this.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-nodes"></i> The "make" syntax {#the-make-syntax}

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" pick"$ZPFX/bin/git-*" make"PREFIX=$ZPFX"
zi light tj/git-extras
```

The `Makefile` of the project above has only 2 tasks:

1. Install the target.
2. Build scripts that are required for installation.

The `Makefile` with 2 tasks, can use:

1. `make"all install PREFIX=‚Ä¶"`,
2. `pick'‚Ä¶'` will `chmod +x` all matching files and add `$ZPFX/bin/` to `$PATH`.

:::info

[$ZPFX][zpfx] is provided by Zi, it is set to `~/.zi/polaris` by default. However, it can be changed by specifying the `$ZPFX=` target.

| ------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## <i class="fa-solid fa-palette"></i> LS_COLORS {#ls_colors}

A repository [trapd00r/LS_COLORS][1] provides a file with color definitions for GNU `ls` command, and also for [ogham/exa][2]. Typically one does `eval $( dircolors -b $HOME/LS_COLORS)` to process this file and set the environment for `ls`. This means `dircolors` is run by every shell startup. It costs much time to create a fork and program, i.e., the `dircolors` binary needs to be loaded to obtain and process the color definitions. The following invocation solves this problem:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice atclone'dircolors -b LS_COLORS > clrs.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' pick"clrs.zsh" nocompile'!' \
  atload'zstyle ":completion:*" list-colors ‚Äú${(s.:.)LS_COLORS}‚Äù'
zi light trapd00r/LS_COLORS
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Syntax             | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `atclone'‚Ä¶'`       | Generate shell script, passing it to `eval`. More: [^1]                                                   |
| `atpull'%atclone'` | Do the same at any update of the plugin. More: [^2]                                                       |
| `pick"clrs.zsh"`   | Source the previously generated file `clrs.zsh`.                                                          |
| `nocompile'!'`     | Invokes compilation **after** the `atclone'‚Ä¶'` [ice-modifier][] and the [exclamation][] mark causes this. |
| `atload'‚Ä¶'`        | Additionally sets up the Zsh completion to use the colors provided by the trapd00r package.               |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

This way, except for the plugin installation and update, `dircolors` isn't run, just normal sourcing is done. The everyday sourced file, i.e. `clrs.zsh`, is being compiled to speed up the loading.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-folder-tree"></i> Direnv {#direnv}

The project [direnv/direnv][5] registers itself in the Z shell to modify the environment on directory change. This registration is most often done by `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` added to `.zshrc`.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' src"zhook.zsh"
zi light direnv/direnv
```

- `make'!'` ‚Äì execute `make` before `atclone'‚Ä¶'` and before `atpull'‚Ä¶'` (see `make` above),
- `src'zhook.zsh'` ‚Äì¬†source file `zhook.zsh`.

In general, direnv works by hooking up to Zsh. The code that does this is provided by the program `direnv` (built by `make'‚Ä¶'`).

Above `atclone'‚Ä¶'` puts this code into file `zhook.zsh`, `src''` sources it. This way `direnv hook zsh` is executed only on clone and update, and Zsh starts faster.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles"></i> Glance at the 'for' syntax {#glance-at-the-for-syntax}

The drawback of this standard procedure is that the `direnv` binary is run on every shell startup and significantly slows it down. Zi allows to solve this in the following way:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi as"program" make'!' atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' \
  atpull'%atclone' pick"direnv" src"zhook.zsh" for \
    direnv/direnv
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Syntax             | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make'!'`          | Compile `direnv`, the exclamation mark means: run the `make` first, before `atclone'‚Ä¶'` and `atpull'‚Ä¶'` hooks.                 |
| `atclone'‚Ä¶'`       | As soon as the plugin is installed generate the registration code and save it to `zhook.zsh`, instead of passing it to `eval`. |
| `atpull'%atclone'` | The `atclone'‚Ä¶'` runs on **installation** while `atpull'‚Ä¶'` runs on **update** of the plugin.                                  |
| `src'zhook.zsh'`   | Load generated registration code                                                                                               |
| `pick'direnv'`     | Ensure `+x` permission on the binary                                                                                           |
| `as'program'`      | The plugin is a program, there's no main file to the source.                                                                   |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

In this method, the registered code is generated once on every installation or update, then sourced without running `direnv` itself. The project is also available as a binary [GitHub releases][6]. This distribution can be installed by:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi from"gh-r" as"program" mv"direnv* -> direnv" \
  atclone'./direnv hook zsh > zhook.zsh' atpull'%atclone' \
  pick"direnv" src="zhook.zsh" for \
    direnv/direnv
```

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| ------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `from'gh-r'`              | Install from `direnv` from [GitHub releases][6].                           |
| `mv'direnv* -> direnv'`   | After installation, rename `direnv.linux-386` or similar file to `direnv`. |
| `atclone'‚Ä¶'`, `atpull'‚Ä¶'` | Same above example.                                                        |
| `pick'direnv'`            | Same above example.                                                        |
| `as'program'`             | Same above example.                                                        |

## <i class="fa-solid fa-pen-to-square"></i> Standard syntax {#standard-syntax}

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ‚Ä¶
zi ice ‚Ä¶
zi load ‚Ä¶
zi light ‚Ä¶
zi unload ‚Ä¶
zi snippet ‚Ä¶
```

The standard method of specifying ices and their values:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi wait"1" from"gh-r" atload"print Hello World"
zi load ‚Ä¶
```

:::note

There's no `ice` that can be used as a subcommand.

:::

## <i class="fa-solid fa-file-pen"></i> The alternative syntaxes {#the-alternative-syntaxes}

However, Zi also supports syntaxes such as the equal (`=`) syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi wait=1 from=gh-r atload="print Hello World"
zi load ‚Ä¶
```

The colon (`:`) syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi wait:1 from:gh-r atload:"print Hello World"
zi load ‚Ä¶
```

And also ‚Äì in conjunction with all of the above ‚Äì the GNU syntax:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi --wait=1 --from=gh-r --atload="print Hello World"
zi load ‚Ä¶
```

## <i class="fa-solid fa-book-bookmark"></i> Summary {#summary}

It's up to the user which syntax to use.

The motivation behind the syntaxes is to utilize the syntax highlighting of editors like Vim ‚Äì and have the strings and ice expressions colorized with a distinct color. However, with the [zi-vim-syntax][] syntax definition this motivation can be superseded with the highlighting specifically for Zi.

[^1]: Save it to file. The `atclone'‚Ä¶'` is being run on the **installation** while the `atpull'‚Ä¶'` hook is being run on an **update** of the [**trapd00r/LS_COLORS**][1] plugin.
[^2]: The `%atclone` is just a special string that denotes the `atclone'‚Ä¶'` hook and is copied onto the `atpull'‚Ä¶'` hook.
