/**
 * Central export point for type definitions
 * This allows you to import types from a single location
 *
 * Example usage:
 * import { HighlightProps, PlayerProps } from '@site/src/types';
 */

// Re-export component types
export * from "./components/ui";

// No exports needed for declaration files (.d.ts)
// They are automatically included by TypeScript
