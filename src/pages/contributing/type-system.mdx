The Z-Shell Wiki uses TypeScript to provide type safety and improve developer experience. This document explains how the type system is organized and how to use it effectively.

## Type Organization

The type system is organized into the following structure:

```tree
src/
  types/
    index.ts                  # Central export point for all types
    components/
      ui.ts                   # Component prop types
      component-modules.d.ts  # Component module declarations
    global/
      files.d.ts              # File/asset module declarations
    modules/
      asciinema-player.d.ts   # Third-party module types
      docusaurus.d.ts         # Docusaurus-specific types
      hooks.d.ts              # Hook-related types
  components/
    types.ts                  # Re-exports from types/ (for backward compatibility)
```

## How to Use Types

### Importing Component Types

When creating or modifying components, import types from the central types module:

```tsx
// Recommended: Using relative imports
import type {ComponentProps} from "../../types";

// Alternative: Using absolute imports (may have resolution issues in some environments)
// import type { ComponentProps } from "@site/types";
```

### Defining New Types

When creating new component types:

1. Add the type definition to `src/types/components/ui.ts`
2. Export it from `src/types/index.ts` (this happens automatically)
3. Use it in your component

```tsx
// In src/types/components/ui.ts
export interface MyComponentProps {
  // Type definition here
}

// In your component
import type {MyComponentProps} from "../../types";

export default function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {
  // Component implementation
}
```

### Type Declaration Files

Type declaration files (`.d.ts`) are used for declaring module types and ambient declarations. These files are referenced in `src/custom.d.ts` and don't need to be imported directly.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Type Annotations**: Always add type annotations to function parameters and return values.
2. **Document Types**: Add JSDoc comments to type definitions explaining their purpose and usage.
3. **Centralize Types**: Define all component prop types in `src/types/components/ui.ts`, including shared types like `FeatureItem` for feature lists.
4. **Avoid Duplicates**: Don't define the same type in multiple places.
5. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Use re-exports when refactoring to maintain backward compatibility.
6. **Run Type Checks**: Regularly run `npx tsc --noEmit` to catch type errors.

## Future Improvements

As the codebase evolves, consider these improvements to the type system:

1. **Increase Type Strictness**: Gradually enable strict type checking options in `tsconfig.json`.
2. **Add Type Tests**: Consider adding tests to ensure type definitions are accurate.
3. **Type Coverage**: Use tools to measure and improve type coverage.
4. **Standardize Imports**: Consider standardizing on absolute or relative imports for better consistency.
