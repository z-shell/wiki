# Copilot Instructions

Copilot and Copilot Spaces must follow all guidelines outlined in files at `src/pages/contributing` for any code or documentation changes.

If a required guideline is missing, Copilot is expected to propose and implement a new guideline to fill the gap.

This ensures that Copilot's contributions remain consistent with the evolving standards of this repository.

Copilot should also stay informed about any updates to the contributing guidelines and adjust its behavior accordingly.
