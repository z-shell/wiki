- [z-shell/z-a-readurl](https://github.com/z-shell/z-a-readurl) annex allows to automatically download the newest
  version of a file to which URL is hosted on a webpage.

It works as follows:

- Invoke `snippet` (or simply pass the `http://…` address using the `for` syntax) on the web-page that hosts the URL to
  the file to download,
- provide `dlink''` ice with the expected file-download URL replacing the version with the `%VERSION%` keyword, also
  provide `as''` ice with one of the following values:

1. `readurl`,
2. `readurl|command`,
3. `readurl|completion`,
4. `readurl|null`.

:::note

The part after the `|` has the same meaning as in the normal `as''` ice.

:::

So, for example:

```shell
zi id-as=fzf as='readurl|command' extract \
    dlink='/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases/download/%VERSION%/fzf-%VERSION%-linux_amd64.tgz' \
        for https://github.com/junegunn/fzf-bin/releases/
```

The snippet is just an example. The same effect is obtained by loading as `junegunn/fzf-bin` plugin with `from'gh-r'`
ice.

As it can be seen, the `dlink''` can be a relative or an absolute path and also a full URL (i.e.: beginning with the
`http://…` prefix).

## Intermediate Download Page {#intermediate-download-page}

Sometimes, like it is in case of [terraform](http://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform) command, the final download link
isn't at the download page, but on a page that's listed on it. In such case use the `dlink0''` ice to provide the
pattern for the additional, intermediate download page. For example, in case of `terraform`, the ZI command is:

```shell
zi id-as=terraform as='readurl|command' extract \
    dlink0='/terraform/%VERSION%/' \
    dlink='/terraform/%VERSION%/terraform_%VERSION%_linux_386.zip' \
    for \
        http://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/
```

## Skipping `dlink''` Ice {#skipping-dlink-ice}

Sometimes the URL of the download page differs from the URL of the archive in just a few `/`-sections. In such case, it
is possible to skip the `dlink''` ice by appending a `++`-separated fragment of the archive URL, like so:

```shell
zi as'readurl|command' extract for \
            http://domain.com/download-page++/archive.zip
```

If the archive URL has some different `/`-sections, then it's possible to strip the conflicting ones from the download
URL by using `+++`, `++++`, etc. – the number of the `/`-section that'll be stripped equals to the number of the `+`
minus 2. So, for example:

```shell
zi as'readurl|command' extract for \
        http://domain.com/download-page/removed-section+++/archive.zip
```

## Summary {#summary}

The annex provides:

1. Two new ices: `dlink''` and `dlink0''`.
2. A handling of the special values of the `as''` ice, i.e.: of `as'readurl'`, `as'readurl|command'`, etc.

The annex works only with snippets, not plugins.

## Install Read URL {#install-read-url}

Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```shell
zi light z-shell/z-a-readurl
```

After executing the above command (possibly via `zshrc`) it's then possible to use the `dlink''` and `dlink0''` ices and
also the special `as'readurl|…'` value of the `as''` ice.

## Sorting The Matched URLs / Package Versions {#sorting-the-matched-urls--package-versions}

Sometimes the download page doesn't list the package versions from newest to the oldest, but in some other order. In
such case it's possible to sort the URLs / package versions by prepending the chosen `dlink` ice (`dlink0''` or
`dlink''`) with the exclamation mark (`dlink'!…'`, etc.). See the next section for an example:

## Filtering The Matched URLs {#filtering-the-matched-urls}

Sometimes there are some unwanted URLs that match the `dlink''`/`dlink0''` regex / pattern. In such case it's possible
to filter them out by appending a filtering regex to the `dlink''` ice as:
`dlink='the-main-regex~%the-unwanted-URLs-regex%'` (or the same for `dlink0''`). An example package that can benefit
from this is the [Open Shift](https://www.openshift.com/) client, which doesn't sort the URLs from latest to the oldest
– hence the exclamation mark (`!`) prepend – and it has special URLs like `stable-4.4` or `candidate-4.5` together with
the regular version URLs (like `4.5.0-rc.1`):

```shell
zi id-as"ocp" as"readurl|command" \
    dlink0'!%VERSION%~%(stable|latest|fast|candidate).*%' \
    dlink"openshift-client-windows-%VERSION%.zip" for \
        https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/
```

The above snippet of Zsh code / ZI invocation will sort the URLs (`dlink0'!…'`) and then filter out the special ones
from the results (via `…~%(stable|latest|fast|candidate).*%`), this way selecting the latest version of the Open Shift
client.
