## <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [z-shell/zzcomplete][]

Complete options from manual pages – press <kbd>Ctrl-F</kbd> to start the completer.

The completion of options has drawbacks:

1. The user has to remember a part of the option he wants to complete.
2. OR he is forced to read through all the options (listed after <kbd>TAB</kbd>).

With ZZComplete, the user can:

1. Search in the manual for arbitrary text related to the option.
2. Then select the option that's located nearby the found text.
3. Also, the user can read about the possible values of the options and select them too.
