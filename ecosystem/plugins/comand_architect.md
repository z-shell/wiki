The Zsh Command Architect allows to copy segments of commands in history, rearrange segments of current command, delete segments of current command. This way user glues command from parts without using a mouse. Advanced history search (multi word, without duplicate lines) allows to quickly find the parts.

Keys are:

- `Ctrl-T` - start Zsh Command Architect (Zshell binding)
- `Enter` - delete selected segment (when in command window) or add selected segment (when in history window)
- `[` or `]` - move active segment (when in command window)
- `Shift-left` or `Shift-right` - move active segment (when in command window)
- `Tab` - switch between the two available windows
- `g, G` - beginning and end of the list
- `/` - start incremental search
- `Esc` - exit incremental search, clearing filter
- `<`,`>`, `{`,`}` - horizontal scroll
- `Ctrl-L` - redraw of whole display
- `Ctrl-O`, `o` - enter uniq mode (no duplicate lines)
- `Ctrl-W` (in incremental search) - delete whole word
- `Ctrl-K` (in incremental search) - delete whole line
- `Ctrl-D`, `Ctrl-U` - half page up or down
- `Ctrl-P`, `Ctrl-N` - previous and next (also done with vim's j,k)

## Install Command Architect

### Standalone

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z-shell/zsh-cmd-architect/main/doc/install.sh)"
```

To update run the command again.

`ZCA` will be installed at `~/.config/zca/zsh-cmd-architect`, config files will be copied to `~/.config/zca`. `.zshrc` will be updated with only `4` lines of code that will be added to the bottom.

After installing and reloading shell give `ZCA` a quick try with `Ctrl-T`.

### With [ZI](https://github.com/z-shell/zi)

Add `zi load z-shell/zsh-cmd-architect` to `.zshrc`. The config files will be available in `~/.config/zca`.

### With Zgen

Add `zgen load z-shell/zsh-cmd-architect` to `.zshrc` and issue a `zgen reset` (this assumes that there is a proper `zgen save` construct in `.zshrc`). The config files will be available in `~/.config/zca`.

### With Antigen

Add `antigen bundle z-shell/zsh-cmd-architect` to `.zshrc`. There also should be `antigen apply`. The config files will
be in `~/.config/znt`.

### Manual Installation

After extracting `ZCA` to `{some-directory}` add following two lines to `~/.zshrc`:

```shell
fpath+=( {some-directory} )
source "{some-directory}/zsh-cmd-architect.plugin.zsh"
```

As you can see, no plugin manager is needed to use the `*.plugin.zsh` file. The above two lines of code are all that almost **all** plugin managers do. In fact, what's actually needed is only:

```shell
source "{some-directory}/zsh-cmd-architect.plugin.zsh"
```

because `ZCA` detects if it is used by **any** plugin manager and can handle `$fpath` update by itself.

### Single File Manual Installation

Running script `doc/generate_single_file` will create single-file version of `ZCA`. It can be sourced from `.zshrc`.

Don't forget about configuration files (copy them to `~/.config/zca`).

## Performance

`ZCA` is fastest with `Zsh` before `5.0.6` and starting from `5.2`

## Fixing tmux, screen and linux vt

If `TERM=screen-256color` (often a case for `tmux` and `screen` sessions) then `ncv` terminfo capability will have `2`nd bit set.

This in general means that underline won't work. To fix this by creating your own `ncv=0`-equipped terminfo file, run:

```shell
{ infocmp -x screen-256color; printf '\t%s\n' 'ncv@,'; } > /tmp/t && tic -x /tmp/t
```

A file will be created in directory `~/.terminfo` and will be automatically used, `tmux` and `screen` will work.

Similar is for Linux virtual terminal:

```shell
{ infocmp -x linux; printf '\t%s\n' 'ncv@,'; } > /tmp/t && tic -x /tmp/t
```

It will not display underline properly, but will instead highlight by a color, which is quite nice. The same will not work for FreeBSD's vt, `ZCA` will detect if that vt is used and will revert to highlighting elements via `reverse` mode.
