- [z-shell/zconvey](https://github.com/z-shell/zconvey)

ZConvey integrates multiple Zsh sessions. They are given an ID, optionally a NAME (both unique), and can send commands to each other.

Use this to switch all your Zshells to given directory, via `zc-all cd $PWD`! Also, there's `zc-bg-notify` **script** (not a function), that will show notification under prompt of every active Zsh session. You can call this script from any program, Bash or GUI.

## [Zstyles](/search?q=zstyle) for ZConvey

The values being set are the defaults. They must be set before loading the plugin.

| Value                                             | Description                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" check_interval "2"       | - How often to check if there are new commands (in seconds)                         |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" expire_seconds "22"      | - If shell is busy for 22 seconds, the received command will expire and not run     |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" greeting "logo"          | - Display logo at Zsh start ("text" – display text, "none" – no greeting)           |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" ask "0"                  | zc won't ask for missing data ("1" has the same effect as always using -a option)   |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" ls_after_rename "0"      | - Don't execute zc-ls after doing rename (with zc-rename or zc-take)                |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" use_zsystem_flock "1"    | - Should use faster zsystem's flock when it's possible?                             |
|                                                   | (default true on Zsh >= 5.3, will revert to mixed zsystem/flock on older Zshells)   |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" output_method "feeder"   | - To put commands on command line, ZConvey can use small program "feeder". Or "zsh" |
|                                                   | method, which currently doesn't automatically run the command – to use when e.g.    |
|                                                   | feeder doesn't build (unlikely) or when occurring any problems with it              |
| zstyle ":plugin:zconvey" timestamp_from "datetime | - Use zsh/datetime module for obtaining timestamp. "date" – use date command (fork) |

## ZConvey commands

| Command        | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `zc`           | Sends to other session; use "-a" option to be asked for target and a command to send              |
| `zc-ls`        | Lists all active and named sessions                                                               |
| `zc-id`        | Shows ID and NAME of current session                                                              |
| `zc-all`       | The same as `zc`, but targets are all other active sessions (with `-f` also busy sessions)        |
| `zc-take`      | Takes a name for current or selected sessions, schematically renames any conflicting sessions     |
| `zc-logo`      | The same as `zc-id`, but in a form of an on-screen logo; bound to Ctrl-O Ctrl-I                   |
| `zc-rename`    | Assigns name to current or selected session; won't rename if there's a session with the same name |
| `zc-bg-notify` | In subdirectory `cmds`, link it to `/usr/local/bin`, etc. or load with e.g. ZI                    |

The main command is `zc` (yet it is rather rarely used, I'm always sending to all sessions with `zc-all`). It is used to execute commands on other sessions. `zc-ls` is the main tool to obtain overall information on sessions. `zc-take` is a nice rename tool to quickly name a few sessions. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl-O Ctrl-I will show current session's ID and NAME
in form of an on-screen logo.

## Install ZConvey with ZI

Add `zi load z-shell/zconvey` to your `.zshrc` file. ZI will clone the plugin the next time you start zsh. To update issue `zi update z-shell/zconvey`.

ZI can load in [turbo mode](/search?q=turbo+and+lucid), below is an example configuration.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0"
zi light z-shell/zconvey
```

Adding `zc-bg-notify` to `$PATH`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0" as"command" pick"cmds/zc-bg-notify" silent
zi light z-shell/zconvey
```

## Manual ZConvey installation

**The plugin is "standalone"**, which means that only sourcing it is needed. So to install, unpack `zconvey` somewhere and add to `zshrc`:

```shell
source {where-zconvey-is}/zconvey.plugin.zsh
```

If using a plugin manager, then `ZI` is recommended, but you can use any other too, and also install with `Oh My Zsh` (by copying directory to `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`).

The plugin integrates with my other plugin [z-shell/zsh-select](https://github.com/z-shell/zsh-select). Install it with e.g. ZI to be able to use `-a` option for `zc` command.
