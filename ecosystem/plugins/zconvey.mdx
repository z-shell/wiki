## <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> [z-shell/zconvey][]

ZConvey integrates multiple Zsh sessions. They are given an `ID`, optionally a `NAME` (both unique), and can send commands to each other. Use this to switch all your Zshells to a given directory, via `zc-all cd $PWD`! Also, there's a `zc-bg-notify` **script** (not a function), that will show notification under the prompt of every active Zsh session. You can call this script from any program, Bash or GUI.

## ZConvey commands

```mdx-code-block
<APITable>
```

| Command        | Description                                                                                            |
| -------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `zc`           | Sends to another session; use the `-a` option to be asked for a target and a command to send           |
| `zc-ls`        | Lists all active and named sessions                                                                    |
| `zc-id`        | Shows `ID` and `NAME` of current session                                                               |
| `zc-all`       | The same as `zc`, but targets are all other active sessions (with `-f` also busy sessions)             |
| `zc-take`      | Takes a name for current or selected sessions, schematically renames any conflicting sessions          |
| `zc-logo`      | The same as `zc-id`, but in a form of an on-screen logo; bound to <kbd>Ctrl-O</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl-I</kbd> |
| `zc-rename`    | Assigns a name to a current or selected session; won't rename if there's a session with the same name  |
| `zc-bg-notify` | In subdirectory `cmds`, link it to `/usr/local/bin`, etc. or load with e.g. Zi                         |

```mdx-code-block
</APITable>
```

The main command is `zc` (yet it is rather rarely used, I'm always sending to all sessions with `zc-all`). It is used to execute commands on other sessions. `zc-ls` is the main tool to obtain overall information on sessions and `zc-take` is a nice rename tool to quickly name a few sessions. Keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ctrl-O</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl-I</kbd> will show current session's `ID` and `NAME` in form of an on-screen logo.

## Install zconvey

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="zi" label="Zi" default>

Add the following to your `.zshrc` file. Zi will clone the plugin the next time you start Zsh. To update issue `zi update z-shell/zconvey`.

```shell
zi load z-shell/zconvey
```

Zi can load in [turbo mode](/search?q=turbo+and+lucid), below is an example configuration.

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0"
zi light z-shell/zconvey
```

Adding `zc-bg-notify` to `$PATH`:

```shell showLineNumbers
zi ice wait"0" as"command" pick"cmds/zc-bg-notify" silent
zi light z-shell/zconvey
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="standalone" label="Standalone" default>

The **standalone"** plugin install, unpack `zconvey` somewhere and add to `.zshrc`:

```shell
source {where-zconvey-is}/zconvey.plugin.zsh
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The plugin integrates with my other plugin [z-shell/zsh-select][]. Install it with e.g. Zi to be able to use the `-a` option for the `zc` command.
