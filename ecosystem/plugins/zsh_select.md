- [z-shell/zsh-select](https://github.com/z-shell/zsh-select)

A shell command that will display selection list. It is similar to `selecta`, but uses curses library to do display, and when compared to `fzf`, the main difference is approximate matching instead of fuzzy matching.

It is written in Zshell and has it's capabilities:

- Patterns, allowing multi-term searching
- Curses module
- Approximate matching (`Ctrl-F`)

The file `zsh-select` can be copied to any `bin` directory. `Zsh` will serve as say `Ruby`, and `zsh-select` will be a regular program available in system.

Pressing `o` will make elements uniqe. To search again after pressing enter, press `/`. Approximate matching mode is activated by `Ctrl-F`.

## Install Zsh Select

Simply copy file `zsh-select` to any `bin` directory such as `/usr/local/bin`.

The package is also available as plugin. `zsh-select` will be available in interactive `Zsh` sessions only when using this method. Nevertheless, integration with `Vim` and other uses will simply work when `Zsh` is your main shell.

Also, plugin managers often allow easy updates.

## Integration with Vim

Adding following snippet to `vimrc` will provide `\f` keyboard shortcut that will run `zsh-select` as file-selector.

Multi-term searching and approximate matching (`Ctrl-F`) will be available. The snippet is based on code from `selecta` github page (MIT license):

```vim showLineNumbers
" Run a given vim command on the results of fuzzy selecting from a given shell
" command. See usage below.
function! ZshSelectCommand(choice_command, zshselect_args, vim_command)
  try
    let selection = system(a:choice_command . " | zsh-select " . a:zshselect_args)
  catch /Vim:Interrupt/
    " Swallow the ^C so that the redraw below happens; otherwise there will be
    " leftovers from zshselect on the screen
    redraw!
    return
  endtry
  redraw!
  exec a:vim_command . " " . selection
endfunction
" Find all files in all non-dot directories starting in the working directory.
" Fuzzy select one of those. Open the selected file with :e.
nnoremap <leader>f :call ZshSelectCommand("find * -type f 2>/dev/null", "", ":e")<cr>
```

## Configuring

There are a few environment variables that can be set to alter `Zsh-Select` behavior.

Values assigned below are the defaults:

```shell showLineNumbers
export ZSHSELECT_BOLD="1"                   # The interface will be drawn in bold font. Use "0" for no bold
export ZSHSELECT_COLOR_PAIR="white/black"   # Draw in white foreground, black background. Try e.g.: "white/green"
export ZSHSELECT_BORDER="0"                 # No border around interface, Use "1" for the border
export ZSHSELECT_ACTIVE_TEXT="reverse"      # Mark current element with reversed text. Use "underline" for marking with underline
export ZSHSELECT_START_IN_SEARCH_MODE="1"   # Starts Zsh-Select with searching active. "0" will not invoke searching at start.
```

## With plugin managers

### [ZI](https://github.com/z-shell/zi)

Add `zi load z-shell/zsh-select` to `.zshrc`. The plugin will be loaded next time you start `Zsh`. To update issue `zi update z-shell/zsh-select` from command line.

### Zgen

Add `zgen load z-shell/zsh-select` to `.zshrc` and issue a `zgen reset` (this assumes that there is a proper `zgen save` construct in `.zshrc`).

### Antigen

Add `antigen bundle z-shell/zsh-select` to `.zshrc`. There also should be `antigen apply`.
