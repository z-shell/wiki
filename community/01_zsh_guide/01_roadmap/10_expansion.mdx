Work in progress!

:::

Global expansion is the operation that expands a wildcard pattern into the list of pathnames matching the pattern. A glob is a short expression that lets you filter files by their name 99% of the time, there‚Äôs an asterisk involved.

```shell
ls ~/**/*.txt # <- THIS IS A GLOB
```

## Globbing TL;DR

:::info

- Global expansion requires `extended_glob`, `dot_glob`, and related options to be enabled, this will treat the `#`, `~`, `^`, and more characters as part of patterns for filename generation, etc.
- Bash won't match a `.` at the start of the name or a slash, to use matching with `.` and `/` use the `dot_glob` option.

:::

Enable the `extended_glob` option in Zsh:

```shell
setopt extended_glob
```

Enable the `dot_glob` option in Zsh:

```shell
setopt dot_glob
```

Enable `dot_glob` with bash:

```shell
shopt -s dot_glob
```

| `(#q)`           | An explicit glob qualifier that makes globbing work within zsh's `[[` `]]` construct                  |
| `(N)`            | Makes the glob pattern evaluate to nothing when it doesn't match (rather than throw a globbing error) |
| `(.)`            | Matches "regular files"                                                                               |

| `(#s)` or `(#e)` | `^` and `$` are in regular expression (beginning of line or end of the line)                          |
| `(#b)` or `(#m)` | Enable back-references                                                                                |
